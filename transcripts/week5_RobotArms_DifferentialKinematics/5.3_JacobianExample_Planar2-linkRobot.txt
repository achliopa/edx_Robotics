Let's make this concrete.
Let's look at a simple robot, for example,
the two link planar manipulator that we've
looked at in the past.
So if these are x and y-axes, then our robot
just looks like this, OK?
And we have the values of the joints.
So this is q2.
This is q2, OK?
And to simplify the problem right here,
I'm going to say that both links of the robot have equal length,
equal to 1.
So each of the links has length equal to 1.
So then, the forward kinematics, which we recall
from the previous lectures.
So the transform from the base to the end effector,
in transform form, is going to be this.
OK, and then, we're going to have OK.
Now, in this lecture, we are going to concern ourselves only
with the position of the end effector and not
its orientation.
So then, I'm going to say that I'll
define the vector x as being simply the end effector
position.
So x is just the position of the end effector.
OK, the vector q is obviously the vector of joint angles,
q1, q2.
OK, and then, x is a function of q, obviously.
And that's forward kinematics.
So x is just a function of q.
And more specifically, by looking just
at the translation part of our forward kinematics,
we immediately see that the way the function works
is that the x-coordinate here, of the end effector,
is c1 2 plus c1.
And for clarity in this lecture, I'm
actually going to expand and formally write
cosine of q1 plus q2 plus cosine of q1.
And then, the y-coordinate is going
to be sine of q1 plus q2 plus sine of q1, OK?
So this is essentially our function f, coming
from the translation part.
Because we decided we only care about the position
of the end effector.
Now, we can write our manipulator Jacobian
using the definition from above.
We know that it's going to be dx dq1 dx dq2 dy dq1 dy dq2.
OK, so let's carry out the differentiation using
these formulas for x and y.
So what do we get?
dx to dq1, so we're going to get a minus sine
of q1 plus q2 minus sine of q1.
Then, dx dq2, so we're going to get minus sine of q1 plus q2.
OK, and then, on the bottom, dy to dq1,
so we're going to get cosine of q1 plus q2 plus cosine q1.
And then, dy dq2, so we're going to get cosine of q1 plus q2.
OK, so let's write our Jacobian up here.
So in this case, the Jacobian is going to be--
and now, again, I'm going to use the shorthand notation, so--
minus sine 1, 2 minus sine 1 minus sine 1,2,
and then cosine 1, 2 plus cosine 1 cosine 1, 2.
OK, notice how the Jacobian is a function of q1 and q2, right?
As q1 and q2 change, the Jacobian
on is going to change as well.
So let's compute the Jacobian for one particular spot,
for one particular robot pose.
Let's say that q is equal to pi/4, and then negative pi/2.
Transpose.
What does the robot look like in that case?
So let's draw our robot.
q1 is pi/4, so the first link bisects this angle.
And then the second joint, q2, is negative pi/2.
Recall that positive q1 goes in this direction,
so that negative q1 is just going to be perpendicular here.
So this is the pose of the robot that we're looking at.
This is x.
And again, here we have this angle is q1,
and then this angle is q2.
And I guess it's negative, so more correctly, it's like this.
So let's spell out the Jacobian.
Let's compute it for this position.
And again, nominally, the Jacobian is a function of q.
So we might as well write that.
We're going to have minus sine of q1 plus q2.
So q1 plus q2 is negative pi/4.
And then minus sine of q1, so that's pi/4.
And again, minus sine of q1 plus q2, so that's negative pi/4.
Cosine of q1 plus q2, so that is q1 plus q2, negative pi/4,
plus cosine of pi/4.
And then finally cosine of q1 plus q2, so cosine
of negative pi/4.
So let's go ahead and replace these values.
So sine of negative pi/4 with a minus in front.
So this is square root of 2 over 2.
And this is minus the square root of 2 over 2,
negative sine of negative pi/4, so again,
square root of 2 over 2 cosine of negative pi/4
plus cosine of pi/4, so that's 2 times square root of 2 over 2.
And then cosine of negative pi/4,
so that's going to be, again, square root of 2 over 2.
So this all goes away.
So here we have 0, and then here we just have over 2.
Just square root of 2.
Alternatively, to make this a little bit more compact,
we can just take square root of 2 over 2 out,
and what we're left with is this.
So this is our Jacobian at that particular position
for that particular position of the robot.
So now what we can do is use it in practice the way
we've seen that the Jacobian can be used.
So as we know, Jacobian times small displacements
of joint angles gives us small displacements
in Cartesian space, which means that if somebody gives
us gives us delta x and we want to compute delta q,
then delta q is the Jacobian inverse times delta x.
So the first question here, now I've done.
I've taken a big, big step, inverting the Jacobian.
And essentially, inverting the Jacobian
is going to be the topic of the next half-lecture,
and it's a very important topic in robot arms.
So what's the situation here?
Well, we can check that the determinant of this Jacobian
is, in our case, square root of 2 over 2 times minus 2.
It's non-zero, so this Jacobian is actually invertible.
Excellent.
So we can write a relationship like this.
So if you just carry out the matrix inversion,
then what you end up with is that the Jacobian inverse is
going to be, and I don't know this by heart,
but this can easily be computed.
So it'll look like this.
Now that we have the Jacobian inverse,
we can plug in some delta x's and get some delta q's.
So how do we want our end effector to move?
Let's say the first thing we want to do
is have the end effector move along the x-axis.
So purely along the x-axis.
Let's say our desired delta x is just
a movement along the x-axis.
Then delta q is going to be Jacobian inverse times delta x.
So what we end up with is, so this is how delta q needs
to move, how q needs to move, how
joints need to change, such that the end effector moves along x.
Let's see.
Does that actually make sense?
We want the end effector to move in this direction.
So now we have a result. This tells us
how the joint values need to change
in order for the end effector to move along the x direction.
Does that make sense?
Well, let's take a look at it.
Let's first get a better drawing of this robot.
So this is the robot in our starting position.
q1 is equal to pi/4, q2 is equal to negative pi/2.
Now, we want the end effector to move purely along the x-axis.
So this is the new position of the robot,
and you can see that q1 has gotten smaller.
So there has been a negative change in q2,
whereas q2 has gotten less negative, if you wish.
So there has been a positive change in q2.
And roughly, q2 has changed by about twice the change in q1.
So it makes sense that if we want the robot to travel purely
along the x-axis, we'd have a negative change in q1
and a positive change in q2.
And it's generally a good idea to try and check
these results intuitively.
And you can generally get an intuition,
if you change a robot joint, what
happens to the end effector.
But you always have to be careful and remember
what positive joint values mean and what negative values mean.
OK let's look at a different exercise.
Let's see that now, instead of a change purely along x,
we'd like our end effector to travel purely along y.
So then the x is going to be 0, 1.
We want the end effector starting from this point
right here to go straight up.
So in that case delta q, the change in joint values,
is going to be the Jacobian inverse multiplied by delta x.
And in this case, what we're going to get is 1 and 0.
So we want the end effector to go straight up.
This is what we want happening.
And you notice an interesting thing.
We have a positive change in q1, and you
can imagine that if Q1 grows, then
the blue point will move straight up,
and we have no change in q2.
So if we want to move straight up,
then q2 doesn't have to change at all.
And that makes sense, because if you imagine a change in q1,
then the end effector is going to move straight up.
But you realize, now, that that's only true
for infinitesimally small delta x's.
In this exact pose, and only in this exact pose,
then obviously, if you only change q1,
the end effector is going to describe a circle.
And the tangent to that circle at this point in space
moves you straight up.
But that's only true at this particular location.
So again, these relationships hold, but only for very,
very small delta x's.
As soon as the robot has moved, you
need to recompute the Jacobian and recompute the change in q,
so delta q, that gives you the desired end effector movement.
