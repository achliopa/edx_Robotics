So let's recap the most important aspects
of differential kinematics.
But before we do that, there's something
I want to stress, because it's a very, very important concept
in the study of robot arms.
Throughout this lecture, we've kept
talking about joint space versus Cartesian space.
And those are two concepts that we need to formalize,
because we're going to be coming back to them again and again.
So let's again, draw our simple kinematic chain.
Let's say that it's one with three joints.
So Q1, Q2, Q3, and an end effector position.
The end effector position is x in Cartesian space.
And then there is a change.
An end effector position is delta x.
So if this is x, this is delta x.
And then a small change in one of the joint angles
is referred to as delta q.
So let's formalize these notions of joint space
versus Cartesian space.
And then there are alternative names for this.
And we people sometimes also refer to it
as end effector space, or maybe task space.
So joint space means the space of possible joint values.
So here we are talking about joint values, which
for revolute joints, means joint angles, for prismatic joints,
means lengths, translations.
But these are joint values, right?
So here, we have the vector q.
A point in joint space means you have decided
some value for all of your joints,
let's say the robot has n joints.
So this is our n, what n is the number of joints of your robot.
Always remember that these are column vectors.
So when you are operating in joint space,
you are talking about joint values.
When you are operating in task space,
you're talking about where your end effector is in your task
coordinate frame, which, let's say you have a base coordinate
frame right here.
Let's say this is x, y, and this is z.
So now you're talking the pose, the position,
and the orientation of your end effector in Cartesian space.
So here in the most general case,
if you add in three dimensions and you
care about the position and the orientation of your end
effector, then a point in Cartesian space
or in end effector space will define
the translation of your end effector along each axis.
But also if you have an end effector whose orientation
matters, then you have also the pose,
the rotation expressed as elementary rotations
around the three axes, so rx, ry, rz.
Again, transpose.
And then this is in R6.
If you only care about the position of your end
effector and not its orientation,
then you only care about this bit of the vector,
and you're in R3.
If you are in two dimensional space
and you care about position and orientation then again,
you are in R3.
But in the most general space, in the more general case,
this is R6.
And now you can see why it's called Cartesian space,
because it's really the pose of the end
effector relative to a Cartesian coordinate frame.
It's called end effector space because we're
talking about the end effector.
It's called task space because really,
what matters for your robot, for example, let's
say you need to be picking up this object from here
and moving it to here.
There's a table here that these objects are sitting on,
and this is the pick and place task that your robot needs
to execute.
Where these objects are located will be defined
in this coordinate frame.
So this is the space of your task.
In the task space, you say I need
the end effector to get to here, and then I
need it to move over here.
So again, that's why this is also referred to as task space.
And in a way, everything that we do
for the analysis of robot arms has
to do with moving between these two spaces.
So if I only think about pose.
If I am given q and I want to ask what
x that q corresponds to, right?
So somebody is giving me the joint angles.
And I need to decide where that places the end effector.
So doing this computation, this is forward kinematics.
If I'm given x, and I'm asking hey,
what are the q's that place the end effector there?
Then this is inverse kinematics.
Then if I'm doing differential kinematics.
So if I'm talking about a small displacement,
I have a small delta q.
So some small change in joint values.
And I want to know hey, what change in end effector position
will that create?
Then this is the Jacobian.
And going back the other way, if somebody gives me delta x
and I want to compute the delta q that produces it,
this is the Jacobian inverse.
And then similarly, that works for velocities.
So if I have a velocity in joint space,
and I'm asking what velocity in Cartesian space
it represents, then going in this direction
is going to be the Jacobian.
Going in the other direction is going
to be the Jacobian inverse.
So this is a good picture to always keep in mind.
We're moving between joint space and task
space and effector space.
These are both high dimensional spaces.
This one is n-dimensional.
This one, in the most general case, is six-dimensional.
I can do forward kinematics, inverse kinematics,
to convert between poses.
I can use my differential kinematics, namely
the Jacobian, to convert small displacements
or to convert velocities.
Velocities and small displacements,
I can always convert from joint space to Cartesian space.
So regardless what pose the robot is in,
if my joints move a little bit, that
will produce some movement in the end effector space.
However, going the other way is only possible
if the Jacobian is invertible.
So only if I'm not in a singular configuration.
If I am in a singular configuration,
the Jacobian is not invertible.
And there will be some delta x for which I cannot compute any
delta q's.
Or conversely, that will be an x dot for which I cannot compute
q dot.
So singularities mean that you lose some ability to move.
Even worse, being close to a singularity
means that a delta x can result in r potentially very, very
large of delta q.
An x dot, a bounded, finite, reasonable x dot
could result in a very, very large q dot,
if the Jacobian is very close to being singular.
So that's something to avoid.
And then finally, the more general way
to remember the Jacobian if you have q and x,
and you remember that forward kinematics
means that x is a function of q.
So if I write x as a function of q,
and this is really nothing other than forward kinematics.
Then my Jacobian is defined as dx1,
dq1, all the way until dx1, dqn.
And then going down all the way until dxm, dq1.
And then keep going until dxmdqn.
So this is the Jacobian.
Another way to remember this is that the Jacobian
relates small joint displacements to small end
effector displacements.
Or alternatively, the Jacobian relates joint velocities
to end effector velocity.
These you have to memorize.
And then joint space, Cartesian space,
moving between these two spaces will hopefully
become second nature by the time we're finished with this class.
