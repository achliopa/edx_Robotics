All right, let's do one more full example of differential
kinematics--
new robot.
As usual, we are given the robot in DH notation.
That's our only starting point.
The goal is to compute the differential kinematics
to say where does this robot have singular configurations,
and explain intuitively what makes
those configurations singular.
So let's get started.
And like always, from the DH table, the first thing we do
is we sketch the robot to give ourselves a sense of what's
going on here.
So let's have our base coordinate frame.
We're going to have an x0 and a z0.
And I'm not going to draw y0 like usual for clarity.
And right off the bat the first degree of freedom-- q1.
So we have the rotation right here around z.
So this is our first degree of freedom, q1.
No translation along z.
A translation by l1 along x.
Right?
Note that in this particular case
l1 is not given to us as an exact number, 0.2 meters
or something.
But still l1 is not a variable.
l1 want is not a degree of freedom.
When you ever see something like this in the DH table,
even if something here is a variable,
it doesn't mean it's a degree of freedom.
It just means it's a fixed length.
It's just given to us as a variable, not as
a specific number.
But still the degrees of freedom the actual joints,
like always in the DH table, can only
go in one of the first two columns--
in the theta column or the d column.
So that means we're going to have a translation along x
by a distance l1.
So that takes us, let's say, keep going up to here.
And then we're going to have a rotation
by 90 degrees around x.
So our next coordinate frame, x1,
is going to be pointing in the same direction as x0.
But z1, since we've rotated by 90 degrees around x,
z1 is going to be pointing like this.
OK.
So then we get to the next row of our DH table.
Then we get to the next degree of freedom, q2,
which is a rotation around z in the theta column.
So then we have the rotation around z.
So this is going to be q2, this rotation right here.
And then we have no translation along z,
no translation along x, another 90 degrees around x.
So we rotate one more time.
So that means x2 is in the same direction as x1.
But then if we do another rotation
around x by another 90 degrees, then we
end up with z2 pointing straight down.
So z2 is pointing straight down.
And then finally our last row in the DH table
we have no rotation around z, but we have a translation
by q3 along z.
So we go down here.
Let's say this is our end effector.
This is the z2 axis.
And then this distance right here, this is q3.
So now we know what our robot looks like.
Let's drop the robot.
So it's basically like this and then going down here.
And this is where the end effector is, right?
The first degree of freedom is rotation
around this access, z0.
The second degree of freedom-- rotation around z1.
q3 is the last degree of freedom them of translation.
Another thing we can do is sketch the robot,
but this time with some non-zero values for all those degrees
of freedom.
So if this is our base coordinate frame,
this is x0, z0, y0, then the robot basically
looks like this.
So it comes out right here, and then this angle is q1.
Then it goes down, let's say like this,
and then this angle right here, this is q2.
And then finally, you have the end effector right here,
and this distance is q3.
The distance from here to here is going to be q3.
So now we have a sense for what this robot does,
is it pivots out here and then in the initial configuration.
So if you want, it sort of looks like this, right?
This degree of freedom means that it can do this.
And then here, it can do this, and this is
the second degree of freedom.
And then of course, it can translate up and down
this axis, and that's the third degree of freedom.
OK.
So now that we have the robot sketch,
let's go ahead and compute forward kinematics.
So what we're going to have is the transform
from the base to the end effector.
And now, we have no choice but to start listing
all of these transforms.
So we're going to start with the first degree of freedom,
which is a rotation around z.
OK.
We're going to have a translation along x.
So we're going to have an identity rotation,
and then we're going to have a translation by l1 along x.
Then we're going to have a rotation around x
by 90 degrees.
So since we are rotating around x by 90 degrees--
it's this rotation, right?
The x-axis stays the same.
The y-axis now points in the direction
that the z-axis used to point to.
So y here points now straight up, and then
z points in the opposite direction
than y used to point to.
So this is the rotation part, and we have no translation.
And we're done with the first row.
The second row, we again have a rotation around z,
and this is by q2 with no translation.
OK.
Then we have another rotation around x by 90 degrees.
So then it's essentially this matrix once again.
OK, and then finally we have a translation along z by q3.
So we're going to have the identity rotation and then
0, 0, q3, 0, 1.
And then if you carry out all of these multiplications,
you get the full transform from the base to the end effector
Let's say that in this case, we only care about the translation
part.
So we only care about the pose of the end effector and not
its orientation.
And in some of the exercises that we'll do in class,
you will very explicitly say when you only
care about the pose, the translation part, and not
the rotation part.
So let's say that here we explicitly say
we only care about the translation
part of forward kinematics.
So if that's the case, then you can make life a little easier
on yourself by just keeping just the translation
part of this last matrix.
And then here you just put yourselves
a vector, so q3, 0, 0, 1.
And that makes it easier to do all of these multiplications,
one by one.
And I'm not going to do them live here.
I'm just going to go straight to the result.
But if all goes well what we should end up with
is the following.
OK.
Let's do a quick sanity check and think about
whether this makes sense or not.
So first of all, we have this point right here,
and we care about its x-coordinate.
So first we have to project this point, which
is under the xy plane, at least for this small q2.
So we have to take this point and project it
onto the xy plane, right?
So this length is q3.
And then to project this onto the xy plane,
it gets multiplied by sine theta 2, which makes sense.
Then we add l1, which is this bit right here.
So l1 gives us the length from the origin
to this point, projected onto the xy plane.
And then finally we project everything on the x-axis,
so we multiply by cosine q1, so this makes sense.
The y-coordinates of the end effector-- similar thing.
We have to project on the xy plane, which
looks exactly the same, and then from the xy plane
we project onto the y-axis.
So it gets multiplied by sine of q1.
So that also makes sense.
And then finally, the z-coordinate is just
this length, which is q3.
So this length projected back onto the z-axis, so multiplied
by cosine of q2.
And you see that the way we've defined it here,
the robot for a q2 of zero goes down,
so we have the minus sign in front.
OK, excellent.
This actually makes sense, so we can proceed
to differential kinematics.
OK.
So I've kept only the translation
part of the forward kinematics.
So the translation from the base to the end effector is that.
Now, in this case, we only care about position, and not
orientation of the end effector.
So then our vector in pose space will just
contain the x, y and z-coordinates
of the end effector.
We know that in this case, the Jacobian,
and it's worth writing again the general formula just so that we
recall it one more time.
So what we'll have is dx dQ1, dx dQ2, dx dQ3, and then dy dQ1,
dy dQ2, dy dQ3, and finally dz dQ1, dz dQ2, dz dQ3.
All of this in matrix form.
This is the Jacobian.
Let's start computing it and see what we get.
So dx, this is our x, dQ1, dx dQ2, and then dx dQ3.
We're done with the first row.
Now we start with dy.
These are all Q's.
So dy dQ1, dy dQ2, dy dQ3.
Let's make ourselves some space.
And then dz dQ1, we notice that the z coordinate does not
actually depend on Q1 in any way, so here we just have a 0
Then we have dz dQ2, dz dQ3.
This is our Jacobian.
Now that we have the Jacobian, let's go ahead
and compute its determinant.
The easiest way to do it is probably
to take advantage of this 0.
So then we will use the last row to expand.
So then we'll have plus, minus, plus, minus, plus, minus,
plus, minus.
So we'll have minus S2 Q3 times minus S1 squared,
s2, s2 Q3 plus L1 minus C1 squared, S2 times
S2 Q3 plus L1.
And then we're going to have another minus, so minus C2
times minus S1 squared, C2, Q3 times S2 Q3 plus L1.
Minus C1 squared, C2 Q3 times S2 Q3 plus L1.
Now we can take out some of the minuses, just
to simplify things for ourselves a little bit.
Then what we quickly notice is that the S1 and the C1
here will go away.
We'll have this times S1 squared plus C1 squared,
and then S1 squared plus C1 squared just goes away.
So we're going to get rid of this,
and we're going to get rid of this.
So from the top, what we'll end up
with is Q3 S2 squared, times S2 Q3 plus L1, and from the bottom
we're going to have the same story.
These will go away.
So then what we'll have is C2 squared,
so Q3 C2 squared times S2 Q3 plus L1.
And then once again, the S2 squared
and the C2 squared will go away.
So then finally, what are going to end up here
is Q3 times S2 Q3 plus L1.
So this is the determinant of our Jacobian.
Let's circle it up, and everything else
we can get rid of.
When is this robot in a singular configuration?
Well, if the determinant of the Jacobian is equal to 0.
So when is this equal to 0?
The first case is Q3 equals 0.
If Q3 equals 0, so this length is 0, then first of all,
Q2 immediately loses the ability to move the robot.
If this length is 0, it doesn't really
matter what you set this angle to.
You won't get any movement.
Also, if this length is 0, that means, for example,
the robot loses the ability to move out of the xy plane
infinitesimally.
So you'll lose a degree of freedom.
You lose the ability to move in some direction.
So that's one singularity.
What about the second one?
So the second singular configuration
is if S2 Q3 plus L1 equals 0.
This one is a little bit more interesting.
What's happening here?
Why is that intuitively a singularity?
And then it takes a little bit more inspection to look at it,
but then we realize that in this case, the robot, for example,
looks like this.
So x, y, and z.
And I'm just going to extend the z-axis down.
So in this configuration, the robot is extended out
and then goes back in like this.
And the end effector is either right
underneath on the negative z-axis,
or maybe it's somewhere up here on the positive z-axis.
But in both cases, the angles are such that all of this
is Q1.
And it doesn't really matter what Q1 is.
This is Q2.
This length is Q3.
And then finally, this bit is length L1.
So basically, if this condition is met,
it means that sign 2 Q3 plus L1 equals 0.
So the end effector is going to be exactly along the z-axis,
either below the origin or maybe above the origin.
And instinctively, why is it a singular configuration?
If the end effector is exactly along the z-axis,
you can imagine that when that's the case,
Q1 loses the ability to move the end effector.
Even if you change Q1, the end effector
will still be positioned exactly in the same spot
along the z-axis.
So that gives you an intuitive explanation
of why this is a singular configuration.
But formally, the answer of what are the singular configurations
of this robot, there are two of them, and these are it.
