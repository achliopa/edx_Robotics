Let's look at another example--
this time three-dimensional-- and that
will be the spherical robot that we've
discussed at the end of the previous lecture.
So this robot has three joints.
And in this case, we'll worry about the position of the end
effector in 3D space.
So here, the vector, x, will be three-dimensional
and will contain the position of the end effector
along the x, y, and z axes.
The q vector, since we have three joints,
will also be three-dimensional.
We'll have q1, q2, and q3.
And we recall from the previous lecture,
the-- from forward kinematics--
the relationship between the position of the end
effector and the joined values.
So here, we're taking just the translation
part of the forward kinematics.
And what we had was this.
OK?
We recall the general formula for the Jacobian in this case.
This is worth repeating because we have to just, in general,
remember it.
So what we're going to end up with is dx, d q1 , dx, d q2,
dx, d q3, dy, d q1, dy, d q2, dy, d q3, and then finally, dz,
d q1, dz, d q2, dz, d q3.
So this is the Jacobian.
OK, so let's go ahead and compute this.
So the Jacobian is going to be dx, d q1, so we're going
to get minus sine 1 sine 2 q3.
Dx d q2-- so cosine 1 cosine 2, q3.
Dx d q3, so cosine 1 sine 2.
Dy to d q1, so cosine 1 sine 2 q3.
Dy to d q2, so sine 1 cosine 2 q3.
Dy d q3, so sine 1 sine 2.
And then finally, dz d q1, so we notice
that z doesn't depend on q1, so this is going to be 0.
Dz d q2, so minus sine 2 q3 and cosine 2.
OK.
Then we can take the determinant of the Jacobian.
And we really have no choice but to go ahead and carry out
the multiplication.
We can take advantage of this 0 right here.
So we use the last row when computing the determinant.
In any case, after finishing the computation,
as long as everything is correct,
what we should end up with is something that looks like this.
So you'll have minus s2 squared q3 squared
minus c2 squared s2 q3 squared.
So then when you add those up together--
so actually, this is cubed.
When you add those together, you will end
up with minus s2 q3 squared.
So let's write that up.
So the determinant of the Jacobian
is minus s2 q3 squared.
So when is this determinant 0?
That tells us when we are in a singular configuration.
So determinant of the Jacobian is 0.
Well, first of all, it's 0 if s2 is 0.
So that means that q2 is 0 or pi.
What does that robot look like in that configuration?
It's this particular case.
So this is for q2 equals 0.
q2 equals pi, The robot points straight down.
So intuitively, why is this a singular configuration?
Well, you can immediately see, for example,
that changing q1 here has no effect on end effector
position, right?
So changing q1 essentially rotates in place,
but the position of the end effector doesn't change.
The same thing happens if the robot is pointing straight
down.
And this also tells us that from this configuration,
we can change--
we can move the robot in the xz plane.
But in this particular configuration,
there is nothing we can do to move the robot, for example,
along the y-axis, right?
If we change q2, the robot will come towards x,
but will stay in the xz plane.
If we change q3, the robot just moves up and down along z.
If we change q1, the end effector rotates in place.
There is nothing we can do to move
the robot along the y-axis.
So those are two intuitions why this
is a singular configuration.
So this is one of them.
The other singular configuration that we have from the Jacobian,
q3 equals 0, is also a singular configuration.
And this is what the robot looks like.
And again here, you can see that both q1 and q2 stop mattering.
If q3 is 0, then there is--
change in q2, change in q1 also has
no effect on the pose of the end effector.
And the only direction that we can move the end effector in
is have it translate in or out by changing q3,
because change in q1 and q2, in this particular pose,
does absolutely nothing.
So that's the intuition why both of these
are singular configurations for the spherical robot.
And in general, a very common type
of exercise that we'll do in the rest of the class is,
say, here's a robot.
Compute forward kinematics.
Once you've computed the forward kinematics,
do the differential kinematics, which
means computing the Jacobian, computing
the determinant of the Jacobian, finding out where
the determinant is 0--
so those are the singular configurations--
the singularities for the robot--
and then trying to obtain some intuition why
that's a singularity, which is also a good sanity check,
right?
Because doing the Jacobian, then computing
the determinant-- which we've actually
skipped in this lecture.
I've let you carry out these computations on your own.
It's kind of a long chain.
It's easy to make a mistake.
So it's always good to double check and say, hey,
for these singular configurations,
do I have an intuitive explanation for what
makes it a singularity?
And what to look for is either a joint that stops mattering,
a joint that has no effect on the end effector pose,
or the fact that you've lost the ability
to move in some direction in space.
