the end.
OK, let's wrap things up with a full kinematics example.
Here's yet another robot, yet another DH table.
And this time, we want to do forward
kinematics, inverse kinematics, and differential kinematics,
so the full analysis for this robot.
Like always, we start with the sketch,
based on the DH parameters.
So let's give ourselves our base coordinate frame.
X0, z0.
The first thing we have is a translation by q1 along z.
That's our first degree of freedom.
So let's say that puts us up here.
So we're going to have z1 pointing still up,
x1 still parallel to x0.
We haven't really done any changes of axis orientations.
And then, this distance, all the way down here,
is going to be q1, OK?
So this is the first part of our robot.
Then, we have a rotation around z.
So q2 is going to be a rotation right here.
We have no translation along z, no translation along x.
But then, we have negative 90 rotation around x.
So that means that x2 is going to be pointing
in the same direction as x1.
But then, z2 is going to be pointing to the side like this.
And then, our third row, where we have no rotation around z,
q3 translation along z.
So then, we're going to go, let's say, up to here.
And no rotation, no rotation, so our final coordinate frame
is going to be z3 pointing like that, x3 pointing like this.
And then, this is going to be the degree of freedom, q3.
Now, we get a sense for what this robot looks like.
So the whole robot can translate up and down right here.
Then, it can rotate around the z-axis.
So this arm can rotate around the z-axis.
And then, finally, the end effector,
it can translate back and forth along this leg of the room.
OK, so we have a sense for what the robot looks like.
Let's go ahead with the forward kinematics.
So the transform from the base to the end effector is--
let's start spelling them out.
The first thing we do have is an identity rotation and just
the translation along z.
So 0, 0, q1, and then 0 and 1.
OK, the next thing we do have is the rotation around z.
So this is q2.
OK, then we have a rotation 90 degrees around x, negative 90
around x.
So that means that the x-axis stays unchanged.
y points down now, right here, right?
So y will be pointing down.
So it means in the opposite of where z used to be.
And then, z now points in the direction where y used to be.
So this is our rotation matrix.
And we have no translation component.
And then, finally, our last matrix,
again, nothing but a translation along z.
So we have the identity, and then 0, 0, q3, 0, and 1.
OK, let's carry out these multiplications.
This one is actually the easiest one.
We have translation followed by rotation.
So really, the only thing that happens
is we can take the translation bit
and superimpose it right here.
So what we'll have is this.
OK, here, we have rotation followed by translation.
So the rotation part stays the same.
Because it gets multiplied by the identity.
But we have to be careful.
Because the translation gets rotated
by this rotation matrix.
So what we end up with is this.
OK, so now, let's multiply these two together
and see what we end up with.
OK, let's do inverse kinematics for position only.
Let's say that we want the end effector to end up
at position ABC in space.
So that basically means that these, the translation
part of forward kinematics, has to put the end effector where
we want.
So what we will end up with is this.
OK, immediately, we get for free, essentially, one
of our degrees of freedom.
We get q1 equals c.
So that's it, just one solution.
And it makes sense, right?
The only robot degree of freedom that
can affect the z-coordinate of the end effector is q1.
And it's immediately obvious that q1
is going to be equal to c.
Then, with these two, let's play the usual trick,
square them up, add them together,
and what we end up with is q3 squared
times s2 squared plus c2 squared equals
a squared plus b squared.
So this goes away.
And then, we have q3 equals square root of a squared
plus b squared.
And don't forget that means two solutions for Q3.
And again, the robot can reach this point either
by pointing towards it and extending by a positive q3.
Or the robot can choose to point in the opposite direction,
and then extend by a negative q3 to reach the same point.
Again, we assume here that there are no joint limits.
q3 can be infinitely positive, infinitely negative.
So then, this gives us two solutions for q3.
OK, now, we actually need to be a little bit careful.
Because we're going get s3 and c2.
Obviously, we have to divide by q3.
So now, we have options.
So if a squared plus b squared equals zero, right?
Well, in this case, we're going to have obviously q3 equals
zero.
So this really only gives us one solution.
So we have one solution for q3.
But then, q2 doesn't matter, right?
If a squared plus b squared equals 0, so essentially
the place where we want to put the end effector
is right on the z-axis.
q3 equals zero will give us that q2 doesn't matter.
So then, we have infinity solutions for q2.
OK, but in the other case, if a squared plus b squared
is not zero, then we're going to have two solutions for q3,
right?
And then, for each value of q3, what
we're going to end up with is s2 is going to be minus a
divided by q3.
c2 is going to be b divided by q3.
And then, q2 is a tan 2 of s2 c2.
So for each solution for q3, we get one solution for q2.
So a total of two solutions for the complete system.
And that's it.
That's the inverse kinematics.
We're done with the inverse kinematics part.
Let's go ahead with the differential kinematics.
Let's write the Jacobian.
By this point, I trust that the general formula
for the Jacobian is known.
So I'm not going to repeat it one more time.
So I'm just going to go right at it.
So the dx dq1, that 0x doesn't depend in q1.
dx dq2, so we're going to end up with minus c2 q3 dx dq3,
so minus s2.
dy dq1 0-- y doesn't depend on q1--
minus s2 q3, and then, finally, c2.
And then, dz dq1 is going to be 1.
And then, dz dq2 dz dq3, this is our Jacobian.
Piece of cake to take the determinant
for such a simple case.
So the determinant of the Jacobian
is going to be minus c2 squared q3 minus s2 squared q3,
so just q3, OK?
When is this robot in a singular configuration?
When the determinant of the Jacobian is 0.
So that can only happen when q3 is 0.
Intuitively, what does that mean?
Well, it means that this leg has length 0.
The end effector is right on the z-axis.
On one hand, it means that q2 cannot move the robot in any
way.
And then, also what it means is that really the only two
movements that are available to the robot
are up and down, or along q3, whatever direction q3 happens
to be pointing in.
So the robot can really only move infinitesimally
two directions, not in the three directions of translation
in x, y, and z.
So this is the only singular configuration
for this particular robot.
So this is a very simple robot, not all that much to it.
But this is a very typical example
for the kind of exercises that we do based on what we have.
We start with nothing but the DH table.
And then, from the DH table, forward kinematics,
inverse kinematics, differential kinematics.
