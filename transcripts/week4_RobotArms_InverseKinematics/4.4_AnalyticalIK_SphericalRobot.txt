OK, let's run through a full robot example for kinematics
and inverse kinematics.
This one is called the spherical robot.
It will become clear in a few minutes why.
As always, what we're given to start with
is the dh parameters.
Go.
And what that means is let's first sketch the robot so
we get an intuition for how it works,
then compute forward kinematics, then
compute inverse kinematics.
So let's start with our coordinate frame.
And we're going to have x0, z0.
The first thing that happens is a rotation around z.
So this is our first degree of freedom, Q1.
Then minus 90 around alpha.
So that means-- or sorry, minus 90 alpha is minus 90,
so around x.
So that means we are rotating around x.
And then z1 is going to point in this direction.
And then x1 is unchanged.
OK.
Then we have Q2.
So we have the next degree of freedom
is a rotation around this axis.
No translation, no translation, 90 degrees around x.
So we get z pointing back up.
So then x2 is pointing the same way.
And then z2 is pointing the same way as z0, so z0 and z2.
We have a prismatic joint.
I think this is the first time we're
looking at a prismatic join for a dh notation.
So now we're going to be translating along the z-axis,
so going up like this.
Up to here, and then this length is going to be Q3.
And then we have no rotation, no rotation
so our axes stay the same.
So then we're going to have x3 z3.
And then finally, our last degree of freedom
is one more time a rotation around z.
And we are done.
OK?
So what does this robot look like in practice?
If we actually make these values--
the values of Q1, Q2-- be non-zero,
then we get a better sense for what the robot looks like.
So if we project this point down in the xy plane--
so this is our basic coordinate frame.
So if we project this point down in the plane,
then this angle here is going to be Q2.
This angle here is Q1.
This distance is Q3.
So this is a prismatic joint.
So this thing can move up and down.
And then finally, the end effector can also
rotate around there for Q4.
So now you get a sense for why this
is called a spherical robot.
And that's because the workspace is a sphere.
So you can imagine this, as you know,
it's just my arm stretched out.
Q1 means I can do this.
Q2 means I can do this.
So the combination of those two means that I can essentially
point the arm in any direction.
Q3 means that the end effector can translate up and down along
the arm, which is something that my arm obviously cannot do.
But this robot can.
And then finally Q4 can also rotate the end effector
all the way to the end.
So you can imagine that an arm, which
has these capabilities, plus this translation,
its workspace, it's going to be a sphere, which is why this is
called the spherical robot.
So the first thing to do always from the dh parameters
is to just sketch the robot, and try
to get an intuitive sense for what the degrees of freedom are
and what each of them does.
Then we have no choice but to bite the bullet
and work our way through the forward kinematics.
So let's go ahead and do that.
So the transform from the base to the end effector
is going to be this, this, this, this, this, and this.
OK?
So let's take them one by one.
For this transform, an easier way to write it down
is, again, the columns are the new axes.
We were rotating around x, so x stays the same.
Then what happens is since we are rotating that into y,
it means y will be pointing in the old direction
of negative z.
And the new z will be pointing in the old direction of y.
So this gives us a quick and easy way
to write a transform like this.
And then the same here, except that now we
are turning back up.
So then x again stays the same.
When you are doing the positive rotation around x,
y points in what used to be z.
And then z ends up pointing in the direction of what
used to be negative y.
Now we have the translation bit.
So we have a matrix where the rotation is identity
and we have 0, 0, Q3.
And then finally the last rotation here.
And then you just go ahead and you carry out
the multiplications.
I'm just going to skip straight through the end.
And I'm also going to make things
a little easier because the rotation part of this
gets really, really hairy.
So I'm going to say that we only care about the translation
of the end effector.
So in the end result, I'm going to write the end result right
here.
There's going to be some rotation part
and we don't necessarily want to compute that.
Which means that you still have to carry out
all of these multiplications but when
you get all the way at the end, you
don't need to multiply the last two rotation bits, which makes
things quite a bit easier.
And then what you end up for the translation part--
always good.
to do a sanity check.
So let's look at this.
The position of this end effector,
well, first of all, one thing we notice
is that Q4 doesn't show up in here at all.
Did we lose it along the way?
Well, it actually-- if we think about it,
it makes sense a little bit--
Q4 is a rotation around this point.
Q4 doesn't change the position of the end effector at all.
It changes its orientation.
But remember, this is our end effector.
I'm drawing the gripper here just for reference.
But really, the position of our end effector
is this point right there.
And rotating around this axis doesn't change the position
at all.
So it makes sense that Q4 just doesn't show up here
in any way.
Then the x, y, and z coordinates of this point--
the z coordinate is going to be Q3 cosine 2, which makes sense,
right?
We're projecting this onto the z-axis.
And then for the x and y, this again makes sense.
Q3 times sine 2 so that projects this point into the xy plane.
And then we have cosine theta 1 to get
it projected to x, sine Q1 to get it projected to y.
So this makes sense.
This makes sense.
This passes our intuitive sanity check.
Now let's take a look at inverse kinematics for this.
Let's say that we want our end effector to end up
at position xyz in space.
Again, we're going to do position only inverse
kinematics.
The orientation bit, too complicated
for our analytical methods right now.
So we want the end effector at position xyz.
So if we look at the forward kinematics,
that just means we end up with a system that looks like this.
So x equals c1, s2, Q3.
y equals s1, s2, Q3.
And then finally, z equals c2, Q3.
And we have to solve this for the values of Q1, Q2, and Q3.
So let's go ahead and do this.
Again, a useful trick--
square them up, add them all up.
And what you end up with is x squared plus y squared plus z
squared equals.
And what you're going to have is Q3 squared times c2
squared plus s2 squared times c1 squared plus s1 squared.
So then this is just 1.
So it goes away, which leaves inside this parenthesis c2
squared plus s2 squared, which again is going to be 1.
So all of this goes away.
And finally, what we're left then
is just this, which gives us Q3.
Excellent.
We are a third of the way there.
Very careful though, we are forgetting one solution here.
When you take the square root, always
remember there are two solutions to that, mathematically.
What does it mean intuitively?
How can we have negative Q3?
Well, if you think about it, if Q3 is positive
and let's say we need the robot to get to this point,
we have a positive Q3.
The robot is reaching in that direction.
The other thing that the robot could do
is point in the exact opposite direction.
And then extend by a negative Q3,
and it gets to the exact point in space.
Is that something that you can physically build?
Can you have a prismatic joint that
can have positive extents or negative extents?
Maybe.
Probably not.
Or at least it wouldn't be practical.
I've never seen a robot with that.
Maybe you can come up with something.
But we haven't told our system anything about limits.
As far as our system knows, these
are the equations that characterize it.
We haven't told it, for example, that Q3 has to be positive.
So in real life, when a manufacturer gives you
the spec sheet for a robot, they will often
also give you joint limits.
They'll tell you Q3 can only be between 0.2 meters and 0.6
meters, for example.
Q1 can only be between 0 and 90 degrees.
We don't know anything about joint limits here.
So then, from a mathematical perspective,
there are two solutions to this equation-- positive Q3
and negative Q3.
And it's our job, as we're doing the IK,
to make sure we have all of our solutions.
So, right here, right off the bat,
we have two solutions for Q3.
OK, now that we have the solutions for Q3,
what do we do for Q1 and Q2?
Well, let's try again more tricks for our equations.
Well, for example, if we square and add up
just these two, what we end up with is x squared
plus y squared is going to be Q3 squared.
And remember, we now know Q3 times s2
squared times c1 squared plus s1 squared.
This goes away.
So this gives us solutions for s2.
So s2 is going to be square root of x squared plus y
squared divided by Q3 square.
Again, very careful here.
Plus and minus, so we have two possible solutions
for sine of Q2.
And then cosine is right here.
So cosine of Q2 is going to be z divided by Q3.
That, we have the sine and the cosine to find.
So for these, we can do Q3 Q2 is going to be a 10 2
of the sine and the cosine.
And since we have two possibilities for the sine,
then we have also two solutions for Q2.
And remember, these, we have two solutions
for Q2 for each of the two solutions for Q3.
So by now, we are at four solutions.
Also, the other thing that we now have to look carefully at
is, wait a second, we are dividing by Q3.
What happens if Q3 is 0?
Because then obviously, we cannot really compute that.
Well, if Q3 is 0, we plug it into here.
Then we obviously, immediately get x, y,
and z is all 0, 0, and 0.
So if x, y, and z are all 0s, then you
have a trivial solution.
Q3 is 0.
It doesn't matter what Q1 and Q2 are.
You will be achieving 0, 0, and 0.
But this is, again, something to not lose track of.
And then, once we also have Q2 computed,
we also have to compute Q1.
By that point, it becomes easy because from this equation
we have cosine of 1 is going to be x divided by s2 Q3.
And remember, we know both of these at this point.
And then from there we're going to have s1 is
going to be y divided by s2--
sorry this is, yes.
Yes, same thing as 2Q3.
And then Q1 is just going to be a 10 2 of sine 1 and cosine 1.
So this uniquely specifies Q1.
So there is just one solution.
So if we multiply these together, two solutions for Q3,
for each of them, two solutions for Q4,
for Q2, for each of them, one solution for Q1.
So all in all, we have four solutions
to our inverse kinematics problem.
That is regardless of where in space x, y, and z are.
So this tells us that this robot has an infinite workspace.
How come?
Again, it boils down to joint limits.
We haven't specified any joint limits.
If Q3 could extend to infinity, then
you can imagine that this robot will have,
indeed, an infinite workspace.
If we had specified it--
look, Q3 has a limit.
It can only get up to there, a certain point.
Then as soon as we did this, we would see that for certain x,
y, and z, you cannot get a Q3 that's legal.
So it will show up over there.
But the way we've defined the robot with no limits,
then there will be four solutions
to inverse kinematics, anywhere in space.
Why force solutions?
Again, always good to try to get an intuition for things.
Well, one way to look at it is, again,
let's say that this robot needs to get right here.
The way we've drawn it here with positive Q1, positive Q2,
that's one way to get to this point.
Now imagine that instead, Q1 you get Q1 plus pi.
So then Q1 gets you all the way to here.
And then instead of a positive Q2, you have a negative Q2.
You can imagine that, in this case,
the robot ends up at exactly the same spot.
Right?
So Q1, Q2, Q3 are a solution.
So you can have, let's say, a certain Q1, Q2,
and Q3 as a solution.
Then Q1 plus pi and negative Q2 and Q3 is also a solution.
So this is one.
This is the second one.
And then, you have the solutions with negative Q3.
So the robot can choose to use Q1 and Q2.
In both of these cases, the robot
can choose to use Q1 and Q2 to point
in the exact opposite direction, but then
extend by a negative Q3 and get to the exact same point
in space.
Again, we haven't placed joint limits in.
So mathematically, all of this is possible.
So if somebody asks you, can you characterize this robot,
you say, well, it has an infinite workspace.
It can achieve any position of the end effector
in this workspace in four distinct ways.
