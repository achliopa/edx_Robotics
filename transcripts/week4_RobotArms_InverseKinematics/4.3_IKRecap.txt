end.
So let's recap our inverse kinematics lecture.
Inverse kinematics is essentially
the task where, if you are given a desired
transform from the base to the end effector,
you have to come up with the values for all
the joint angles, qi.
The way you do it, at least for analytical, ik,
you compute forward kinematics, and then
you just invert it to get inverse kinematics.
And you get an analytical formula
for your inverse kinematics.
And often that involves trigonometry,
using simple tricks.
Always good to remember the formulas
for sine and cosine of sums and differences of angles.
Sine squared plus cosine squared equals 1.
We'll do a couple of more examples where
we'll use these little tricks again and again.
But then what we ended up seeing, for example,
we did a little example for a planar two-link robot,
which has two links, with the first link being a little
longer than the second.
And then what happens is we saw that that robot has
what's called a workspace that's shaped like a donut.
Anything outside the outer circle,
the robot cannot reach in any way.
Anything right on the boundary, the robot
can reach in just one way, which is with the arm fully stretched
out.
Anything inside the circle, the robot can reach in two ways.
But then there's also an inner circle.
Anything on the boundary of the inner circle, the robot
can reach in just one way, which is completely bent back
on itself.
Anything inside the inner circle,
the robot cannot reach at all.
So the number of solutions for inverse kinematics,
we have zero solutions outside, one solution on the boundary,
two solutions inside, one solution
on the inner boundary of the workspace,
and then again, zero solutions outside the workspace
in the inner circle.
And this is something that you see very, very often, where
the number of solutions for inverse kinematics
varies depending on where you are in space.
And, then we talked about how the number of degrees
of freedom of the robot relates to the number of solutions
for inverse kinematics.
In 2D space, position and orientation
are specified using three variables.
So a robot will need at least three degrees of freedom, such
that it can achieve any position and orientation
in some workspace.
In 3D space, the robot is going to need at least six degrees
of freedom, because you need six numbers to specify position
and orientation.
So a robot will need at least six degrees of freedom
such that it can reach any position orientation of the end
effector for some workspace.
If a robot has fewer than these number of degrees of freedom,
then it's restricted in terms of what it can do.
If it has exactly these many degrees of freedom,
so if it's a 3D robot with six degrees of freedom,
it'll have some workspace where it
can reach any position orientation
in a finite number of ways.
If it has more than this number of degrees of freedom,
then it's a redundant robot, and there
will be some part of the workspace
where the robot can achieve any pose for the end effector
in infinitely many ways.
A good example of a redundant arm with seven degrees
of freedom is the human arm.
