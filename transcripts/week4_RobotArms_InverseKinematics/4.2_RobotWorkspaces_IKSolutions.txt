What if we also add orientation?
What if we throw orientation into the mix?
What if we say that, hey, you know what?
After all, I care about the orientation of my end effector
and not just its position.
This is what my robot looks like.
Now I have an end effector whose orientation matters.
And what I'd like to do is get my end effector
to a certain position in space.
So I'm going to have a desired a and b.
But now I also care about the orientation of my end effector.
So the angle that the end effector
makes with the horizontal, this is now important to me.
I want to achieve that.
So now, then, obviously we'd have
to achieve these three variables using our forward kinematics.
So we can try to say, just as before, the translation part is
going to be called a and b.
And then the rotation part should end up
being a rotation by gamma.
And we can attempt to solve that resulting big system.
So in that case what we'd be saying
is, if we do it in matrix form, then what we'd like
is for these matrices to just be equal.
So this is our forward kinematics.
We need this to be equal to--
Can we go ahead and solve this?
Don't bother.
We cannot.
And what's the intuition between that?
Well, now basically we are asking our robot
to achieve an end effector pose specified by three
variables, a, b, and gamma.
In matrix form this can be confusing
because the matrix form, as we've talked about,
is redundant.
You have more numbers than actual degrees of freedom.
But fundamentally, we are asking for a position and orientation
in 2-D space.
Position and orientation in 2-D space
is defined by three variables.
So two for position, one for orientation.
But then the only means that the robot has at its disposal
are two joints, q1 and q2.
So something has to give.
It's impossible for the robot to achieve any combination of a,
b, and gamma using q1 and q2.
OK.
So there is no part of the workspace where the robot can
achieve any combination of position and orientation
for the end effector.
We've seen before that there is some finite workspace
in the shape of the donut in which the robot can achieve
any position.
But once you have achieved the position, once q1 and q2 have
been set in order for you to achieve a and b,
gamma is also set.
There is nothing you can do to change it.
This robot has just two degrees of freedom.
You can use those two degrees of freedom, maybe to set a and b.
You cannot use them to also decide on the gamma that you
want.
The gamma is decided once you set a and b.
If you want a robot that can achieve any a, b, and gamma,
then what you need is another degree of freedom.
You can maybe add another joint.
You don't even necessarily need another link.
So you have one rotation here, you have one rotation here,
if you add one rotation and the wrist.
So if you now add a q3, now your robot
has enough degrees of freedom that you
can think about achieving any position
and orientation somewhere.
There will be some part of the plane
where you can achieve any position and orientation.
Even with q3, the robot cannot reach infinitely far.
So there will be part of the plane that the robot simply
cannot get to, that you'll have no solutions.
But at least there will be some part of your workspace
where you will have a solution for any combination of a, b,
and gamma.
So now we're going to extend this intuition
to three dimensions.
OK, so now let's look at 2-D space and 3-D space
to really understand the relationship between robot,
number of joints, number of degrees of freedom,
and what they're end effector can achieve.
So let's think about 2-D and 3-D. Obviously, in 2-D
space we're talking about the plane, x and y.
In 3-D we are talking about the full Cartesian 3-D space.
x, y, and c.
OK.
How many variables does it take to fully specify
the position and orientation of a body in space?
So variables, for position and orientation.
If I have a body in 2-D space, and I
want to specify the position and the orientation,
I'm going to need x, y, and theta.
OK.
So it's three variables that are needed to fully specify this.
In 3-D space, if I want to completely specify
both the position and the orientation of the body,
I'm going to need six variables.
And this is something that we've stressed
at the end of the transform lecture.
So in this case it can be, for example, x, y, and theta.
Here we're going to have, for example, x, y, z, and then
roll, pitch, and yaw, as an example.
But it's really six variables.
So now let's think about our robots.
OK, now let's look at robots.
And what we are going to do is compare the number
of degrees of freedom of the robot
and the number of solutions, the number of IK solutions,
for arbitrary x, y, and theta.
So if the robot has less than three degrees of freedom,
has fewer than three degrees of freedom, there is no workspace.
There is no part of the plane where the number of solutions
is more than 1.
So here the number of solutions is going to be 0.
There will always be, everywhere in the plane,
some combination of x, y, and theta, that you cannot achieve.
Maybe a robot, if it has two degrees of freedom,
maybe it can achieve x and y.
There's some part of the workspace where you
can achieve arbitrary x and y.
It won't be able to achieve arbitrary theta.
And the arbitrary is important.
Because it will be able to achieve some combinations of x,
y, and theta.
But no, there is no workspace where
it can achieve any combination of x, y, and theta.
If the robot has exactly three degrees of freedom,
there is some workspace.
That is where this is finite.
So the number of solution is going
to be greater than 0 and finite for some workspace,
assuming that your robot is well-designed.
It's possible to design a robot with three degrees of freedom,
where this doesn't hold.
But you'd have no reason to design or build
a robot like that.
So again, chances are your robot won't
be able to reach to infinity.
So there will always be some parts of space
where the number of IK solutions is 0.
But there will be some workspace.
Recall, for example, the donut-shaped workspace
that we've seen in the past.
There's going to be some workspace where
the robot can reach any combination of x, y, and theta.
So inside this little piece of space,
you can reach any combination of x, y, and theta
in a finite number of ways.
Maybe one, maybe two, maybe four, six, and so on.
If the number of joints is greater than 3,
then you might even have what's called
a redundant robot, where the number of solutions
can be infinite in some workspace.
And this is the case, for example, for the human arm.
We'll get to that when we look at six dimensions.
And redundant robots, which is this case,
we're going to look at them a little bit in more depth later
in the course.
What about in 3-D?
Again, let's look at the number of degrees
of freedom versus the number of IK solutions
for arbitrary problem.
Very, very Similar situation.
If your robot has less than six degrees of freedom,
then there will never be a part of the workspace
where it can achieve any position and orientation
for the end effector.
If it has exactly six degrees of freedom,
there will be some workspace where it will have greater
than 0, finite ways to achieve any possible position
and orientation.
And then if you have more than six degrees of freedom,
then there will be some workspace
where you'll have infinite ways to achieve any combination
of position and orientation.
So let's look at an example of each of these.
And in particular, the 3-D case.
OK for the first case fewer than six
degrees of freedom, a simple example
is the Scara robot that we've looked at already.
Right?
The Scara robot has four degrees of freedom.
There Is a rotation around this axis.
There is a rotation here.
There is a rotation here.
There is translation.
And then you might even add the 5th degree
of freedom, which is going to be the rotation around the end
effector.
The Scara robot is useful, it can pick things up.
But if you think about it it's end effector
is always pointing down.
Right?
It can rotate around the vertical axis,
and it can reach there some finite places
where it can reach any given position.
But there is no way for this robot
to make the end effector point towards you for example.
To make the end effector point out anywhere other than along
this vertical axis.
Right?
There is no work space where this robot
can achieve any position and orientation for the end
effector.
There's some work space where it can achieve any position
of the end effector.
It can actually achieve any position in multiple ways.
Right?
And imagine the elbow towards us,
or the elbow towards the back.
But there is no work space where it
can achieve any position and orientation for the end
effector.
For the sixth [INAUDIBLE] case, our robot
would be exactly six degrees of freedom.
Again we're going to quickly look
at a model of a Puma robot.
This is a commonly used, very popular,
one of the most popular for a long period of time
industrial robot arms from a few decades ago.
And this robot has exactly six degrees of freedom.
One, two, three, four, let's get to four.
Four, five, and six and there's some work space
where it can actually place the end effector in any position
and orientation.
And that work space is finite, it obviously cannot reach
infinitely far away for example.
And that workspace might have an interesting shape.
But it exists, and it has volume.
Right?
And somewhere in that work space this robot
might actually even be able to achieve the same position
and orientation in multiple ways.
One thing that you can imagine, for example,
and this is again very typical for this kind of robot.
Let's say that there is a specific position
and orientation that I want, and the robot
might be able to achieve it either with the elbow pointing
up or with the elbow pointing down.
So there will be a finite number of ways
in which it will be able to achieve any position
and orientation.
And because of this right, because six degrees of freedom
is the minimum number that gives you some work space
where you can achieve any position and orientation.
Because of that six degrees of freedom
is a very popular configuration with robot manufacturers.
You're going to see a lot of industrial robots
have exactly six degrees of freedom.
People will often refer to them as six axes robots, right.
Some configurations with fewer than six degrees of freedom
are useful.
The Scara robot is actually commonly used
for pick and place.
But when an industrial robot manufacturer
wants to build a general purpose robot arm more often than not,
they're going to build that with six degrees of freedom,
because that means that you're giving the user some workspace
where the end effector can be placed
in any combination of position and orientation.
OK.
What about a robot arm with more than six degrees of freedom?
Well, we all have a couple of examples nearby.
The human arm.
So we are not going to talk about robot arm,
we are going to talk about the human arm.
The human arm if you think about it
has seven degrees of freedom.
Right?
Let's count at the shoulder I have three axis of rotation,
I can rotate like this, I can rotate like this,
or I can rotate like this.
So around vertical.
Then around the axis coming out of the screen.
And then finally around this axis.
Then I have one degree of freedom and the elbow.
And then three degrees of freedom at the wrist.
One rotation, two rotations, three rotations.
The row, you can think of it as being at the wrist,
you can think of it as being at the elbow.
It doesn't really matter all that much.
But fundamentally I have seven degrees of freedom of the arm.
Which means that there is some work space where
I can achieve any position and orientation,
and I can achieve it in infinitely many ways.
Right?
So for example, if what I'm going to do is place
my end effector in a certain pose, and just my end effector
isn't moving.
Right?
Notice that I can still move my arm around.
So I have an infinity of ways in which I
can achieve this particular position and orientation
for the end effect.
Anything inside this interval, this continuous interval
will be a solution.
So I have infinitely many solutions
for that particular inverse kinematics problem.
And this becomes an interesting point.
So the human arm, not only is it fully actuated in that it
can get to any position and orientation in space
it's actually redundant.
Why?
Nobody knows of course why, but one possibility
may be look in the real world, which is messy and full
of obstacles, it's not enough to be
able to reach anywhere you need to be able to reach anywhere
in many, many ways.
Because you might have to reach around things, under things,
over things, avoid obstacles.
Right?
So maybe this is why seven degrees of freedom
redundancy make such a difference for the human arm.
Are there robot arms with more than six degrees of freedom?
Yes.
Not surprisingly, they are used a lot in research.
Not as much an industry where six degrees of freedom
is much more common.
In industry as you've seen in our examples
that we started with you control the environment.
So you have the robot moving things around,
you can take the obstacles out.
You can design your environment such
that the robot doesn't have to reach around obstacles, over,
under things.
So maybe you don't need six degrees of freedom,
where you have a really complicated environment
where you might have to avoid obstacles
then people will use a robot with more than six degrees
of freedom even in industry.
But because you're controlling the environment
six degrees of freedom is much more common.
Remember any degree of freedom, any additional degree
of freedom costs money.
A robot with seven degrees of freedom
will be more expensive than a robot
with six degrees of freedom.
Are there robots with eight, nine, ten degrees of freedom?
Robot arms, actually in most cases it stops at seven.
When people build redundant robot arms
you need one more than six at least.
So you build it with seven.
There are of course, examples of prototypes especially research
results with robots with more than 7 degrees of freedom.
If you think about an elephant trunk, or an octopus arm.
Right?
Those can be modeled as having a lot more degrees of freedom
than seven.
And very, very versatile.
But again robots manufactured in large numbers,
you will have seven degrees of freedom
if they are to be redundant.
Six degrees of freedom in many cases, less than six
for specialized robots like a Scara robot doing pick
can place.
