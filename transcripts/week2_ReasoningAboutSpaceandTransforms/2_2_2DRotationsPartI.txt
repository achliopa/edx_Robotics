What are these transferred objects?
So here we have coordinate frame A, shown
in white, coordinate frame B, shown in yellow.
And let's say we know the location of point
p in coordinate frame B. So pB, which in our case
is px in coordinate frame B and py in coordinate frame B,
is given to us.
What we'd like to do is compute pA.
So it's a fairly simple matter of trigonometry
to compute pAx and pAy based on what we know.
So for example, pAx, the projection
of p along the x-axis of coordinate frame A
is going to be pBx times cosine of theta minus pBy times sine
theta.
So we take this bit up to here and we project it down onto x.
So that's pBx cosine theta.
But then we have to subtract this part, which
is pBy sine theta.
So that gives us pAx.
Similarly, pAy is going to be pBx sine theta plus pBy cosine
theta.
OK, so now that we have derived pAx pAy,
let's rewrite this exact same relationship in matrix form.
So what we have is that pA, which is just a column vector
pAx pAy is going to be a matrix.
So cosine theta minus sine theta, sine theta cosine theta.
Times pBx pBy.
Which, as you can see, is nothing other
than pA equals R AB times pB.
And the reason why I've used the letter R for this matrix
is that this is what is called a rotation matrix.
So in our case, the coordinate frames A and B
differ only by a rotation.
So B is the same as A, but rotated around theta.
So in this case the transform T from A to B is a rotation.
And this is what we refer to as a rotation matrix.
So multiplying point pB by the rotation matrix
gives us that same point but expressed in coordinate frame
A.
OK, let's make this concrete with a numerical example.
So let's say we have our coordinate frame A
and B is the same as A but rotated by 45 degrees.
So these are xB and yB.
This is xA and yA.
And let's say that point p, expressed in coordinate frame
B, is 2, 0.
So we move by two units along the x-axis of B. Let's
say this gets us to here.
And zero along the y-axis of B. So this
is our point p in coordinate frame B.
What is that same point, but expressed
in coordinate frame A?
So we can write the rotation matrix.
So the rotation from A to B is, as we just said,
cosine theta minus sine theta, sine theta cosine theta.
In our case theta is 45 degrees.
So we're going to get, with a little bit
of rounding, 0.7 minus 0.7.
0.7, 0.7.
So then the point p in coordinate frame A
is going to be our rotation matrix from A to B times
that same point expressed in coordinate frame B.
So we have the rotation matrix times point p.
So 2, 0.
And if we carry out the multiplication,
we're going to get 1.4, 1.4.
And you see that this same point p expressed in coordinate frame
A is indeed at 1.4 and 1.4.
So let's talk a little bit more about rotation matrices.
First of all, what are we rotating around?
Well, so far we've been operating in 2D world.
In 2D, there's only a single possibility for rotation.
The only axis you can rotate around
is the axis that's not shown on this graph,
is essentially the z-axis.
So if I plot a z-axis, for example, like this,
the hidden assumption whenever I do a rotation matrix in 2D
is that I am rotating around z.
Obviously if I were to rotate around x or y,
then I would no longer be in 2D.
I would come out of the plane that I'm operating in.
So in 2D, all rotations are around the z-axis.
We'll get to 3D in a few minutes,
and then the rotation matrices become a little bit more
involved.
But all the properties that I'm just
about to mention always, always hold.
So whenever you see a rotation matrix,
there are a couple of things that you know are always true.
So first of all, the determinant of a rotation matrix
is always one.
And even more than that, rotation matrices
are always orthonormal.
What does that mean?
The norm of every column is one.
The norm of every row is one.
The dot product of any two columns is zero.
The dot product of any two rows is also zero.
And we can very easily check that.
The norm of this column, cosine squared plus sine squared, one.
The norm of this column, sine squared
plus cosine squared, one.
If we take the dot product of these two columns,
we're going to get cosine times negative sine plus sine times
cosine cancels out.
So we get zero.
So these are things that you always want to remember.
Whenever a matrix does not obey these rules,
it cannot be a rotation matrix.
Then there is one more property of rotation matrices, which
actually follows from the two above,
which is that its inverse is the same as its transpose.
And this is also pretty easy to check, if we take this matrix
and we multiply by its transpose.
If you carry out the multiplication,
you get the identity.
So these are the ways in which you can tell a true rotation
matrix.
And this is also a very handy rule,
because now we've seen that if you
have R, the transform from going from A to B, if you have this,
then you can always very easily calculate the transform
from going from B to A, which is going
to be the transform from A to B simply transposed.
So in our previous example, we had coordinate frame A and B.
And we had just determined that point p, expressed
in coordinate frame A, was 1.4, 1.4.
And the rotation from A to B was 0.7 minus 0.7.
0.7, 0.7.
So using this handy rule, the rotation from B to A
is going to be 0.7, 0.7 minus 0.7, 0.7.
So now we can compute point p expressed in coordinate frame
B as the rotation from B to A times point p expressed
in coordinate frame A. So we're going
to have the rotation matrix times pA.
So what we end up with, of course,
with a little bit of rounding, is 2, 0,
which is the point p in coordinate frame B
that we started with at the beginning.
And you can see that p in coordinate frame B
has coordinate two along the x-axis
and zero along the y-axis.
