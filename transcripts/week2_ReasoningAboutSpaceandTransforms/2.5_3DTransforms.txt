OK, let's get to three dimensions.
So far into the course, and we're
barely making it to three dimensions now.
Well, the reason is that it's not really any more complicated
in 3D than it is in 2D.
Everything that we've seen still holds.
Of course, any vector, now p, is going
to have px, py, pz, a homogeneous coordinate.
But other than that, everything that we've talked about
is still true.
A transform matrix from a to b still
has the exact same structure.
It's going to be a rotation from a to b.
It's going to be a translation, which
is going to have three terms.
Then you'll have the 0 and the 1.
The rotation matrix is 3 by 3.
The translation part is 1 by 3.
And then you have this bit and this bit
in terms of dimensions.
The only additional thing to think about right
now is that now rotations can be around any arbitrary axis.
In 2D, the rotations could only be around the z-axis.
Now in 3-D, we can combine rotations around any axis.
So the rotation matrices have different forms
depending on which axis we are rotating around.
So if we are rotating around the x-axis by theta,
then the rotation matrix is going to look like this.
If we are rotating around the y-axis.
And then similarly, if we are rotating around the z-axis.
What's an easy way to remember the structure for rotations?
Well, you can think that, again, the new orientation of the axes
after the rotation, you can find it
as the columns of your rotation matrix, that's still true.
So if I draw my coordinate frame, xy and z.
Let's say that I rotate this around the x-axis.
I grabbed the x-axis, and I rotate my coordinate frame
by theta.
So now my new y is going to look like this,
my new z is going to look like this,
and I have the angle theta here.
Well, what is one thing that we notice?
The x-axis hasn't changed.
And of course, it hasn't.
We are rotating around x, so x won't change.
And you see that the new orientation of x
is the same as the orientation of x, 1, 0, 0.
Similarly, if I grab my coordinate frame by y,
and I rotate by y, y stays the same.
If I rotate by z, then z stays the same, and x and y change.
So that's one way to remember the structure
of these matrices.
Also, one thing you can look at is if you rotate by z,
you get in the top left the well-known, the 2D rotation
matrix that we've been happily using so far.
So still the same structure for transform
matrices in 3D as we had in 2D.
And the same properties for rotation matrices.
In 3D as in 2D, the determinant is 1,
and the inverse is the same as the transpose.
These still hold, and these are very important to remember.
Let's do an example.
This is our coordinate frame a, so we're
going to have x, y, and z.
And a transform matrix.
So the transform from a to b is going to be--
Is this a valid transform matrix?
0 is here, 1 here.
Rotation part has to be orthonormal.
Translation part?
This is a valid rotation matrix.
Which one is coordinate frame b?
Well, let's look at a translation.
So we have to go by three units along x, three units along y.
So then this is where the origin of frame b is.
What do the axis of b look like?
We can inspect the columns of the rotation matrix.
So the x-axis of b is going to point
in the old direction of y.
So this is going to be xb.
The y-axis of b will point along our old negative x.
So this is going to be yb.
And then finally, z is unchanged.
It's pointing up, which really tells us
that the rotation to get from a to b
is a rotation around the z-axis.
So to get from a to b, we've translated to here,
and then rotated by 90 degrees around the z-axis.
Now let's look at a point in coordinate frame b.
Let's say that pb is minus 2, 2, 1.
Always remember the fourth coordinate, which has to be 1.
So minus 2 along x, which gets us to here.
2 along y gets us to about here.
And then we go up along z.
So this is our point, p.
That point p expressed in coordinate frame a
is going to be the transform from a to b
times the point in coordinate frame b, which is going to be--
let's do this.
Minus 2 plus 3, minus 2 plus 3, 1, and 1.
So 1, 1, 1, 1.
Thankfully, the fourth coordinate is 1.
No mistakes there.
1, 1, 1.
That visual inspection looks like the correct location
of point b in coordinate frame a.
