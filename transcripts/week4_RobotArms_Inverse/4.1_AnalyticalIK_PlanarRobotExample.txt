Today's lecture is about inverse kinematics,
which, as you might guess by the name, is in a way
the opposite problem of forward kinematics,
which we've started last time.
So let's briefly recall what we mean by forward kinematics.
So assuming that you have a robot
arm, a collection of links and joints,
where each joint has a joined value.
And then based on those joint values,
if you have a base coordinate frame and end
effector coordinate frame, then you can compute the transform--
wrong transform-- you can compute the transform
from the base to the end effector.
So forward kinematics, if somebody is giving you
all the Qi's, then you can go ahead and compute the transform
from the base to the end effector.
So this is forward kinematics.
And it's not just the end effector,
we can compute the transform from the base to every link.
But the one you care about quite often is the end effector.
So this is forward kinematics.
But in the real world when you're using a robot,
you actually care a lot more often
about the inverse problem.
You know where your target object is.
So let's say that you'd like your end effector to be here
to grab this object.
So you know the desired transform
from the base to the end effector.
What you don't know is what are the joint values
that your robot must have in order
to get to the end effector to the desired point in space.
And that is the inverse kinematics problem.
You are given a desired transform
from the base to the end effector
and what you have to do is compute all the joint values
that produce that transform.
And in particular, in this lecture,
we're going to be looking at analytical methods
for computing the joint values.
Later we'll also look at numerical options,
but for now it's important to start with analytical methods
because those will give us some very important insights
into the capabilities of robot arms in general.
We're going to start with a simple problem in just two
dimensions and we're going to do inverse kinematics
for the planar two-link robot, which we've seen already.
So let's briefly recall what are the DH parameters
for the planar two-link robot.
So two links, two joints.
This is a pretty common way in which you'll
see problems phrased in this class,
here are the DH parameters, sketch the robot,
do forward kinematics, do inverse kinematics.
So let's very quickly sketch our robot right here.
We know it's a two dimensional robot,
so we'll have our x and y-axes.
So the first degree of freedom is a rotation around z.
The z-axis is coming out of the board.
This is a 2D problem, so we're not really going to draw it.
So we're going to have--
this is going to be Q1.
And then there is a translation along x.
So after we've rotated by Q1, x is pointing along the link.
So by 0.5, so the length of this link is 0.5.
And then here we're going to have another rotation by Q2.
And then the length of this link is 0.3.
And this is our end effector right here.
This is what the robot looks like.
To do inverse kinematics, first you
have to do forward kinematics then invert it.
So let's very briefly again recall
how we have to do the forward kinematics for this robot.
So in DH parameters, so we're going
to have a rotation by Q1 around z, translation
by 0.5 along x, rotation by Q2 around z,
translation by 0.3 along x.
We're going to be using the 2D version of the transfer
matrices just to make life simpler for ourselves.
So the transform from the base to the end effector
is going to be rotation by theta 1, then translation by 0.5
along x, then rotation by theta 2, then translation by 0.3
along x.
And then at this point, we just carry out the multiplications.
When doing this, it's always useful to have
handy our formulas for the sine and cosines
of angle sums and differences.
So we're going to say that cosine of Q1 plus Q2,
which we're going to use shorthand here as cosine 1 2,
is going to be C1 C2 minus s1 s2.
And then if this is a minus, then this becomes a plus.
And then similarly, sine of Q1 plus or minus
Q2, which we use as 1 2 as a shorthand,
is going to be s1 c2 plus minus c1 s2.
So these are always useful to have around and memorize
as well.
So if we use these and we carry out these multiplications, what
we're going to end up with is--
what's a good place to write this down?
The final result for forward kinematics,
we're going to have--
and then for the translation part--
So this is our forward kinematics.
The transform from the base to the end effector,
forward kinematics.
This is our starting point.
Now let's assume that we want our end effector
to be at this position in space.
So it will have coordinates a and b.
And in particular, what we're going to do quite a bit
in this part of the course is look at position only IK.
So we're not going to care about the orientation of the end
effector, let's say that the orientation doesn't matter.
The end effector is just a point and we
want that point to be at a given position a, b in space.
How do we achieve that?
Well, it obviously means that the translation
part of our forward kinematics has to take us to the point a,
b in space.
So in other words, what we have is
that if we look at the x component, this has to equal a.
And then the y component has to equal b.
So inverse kinematics basically means
solving these two equations.
