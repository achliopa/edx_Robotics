We have reached the last lecture of the class,
and today we are not going to introduce any new material.
It's a chance to look back at the things we've seen so far
and, again, take stock of where is
the field, the state of the art in robotics, what's
been done so far, what's happening right now, where
is the future going to lead us.
And we are going to look at all these armed with the knowledge
that we've acquired throughout this class.
So let's get started.
And first, let's look a little bit again at the past.
And I like to think of it not just as the past but,
really, the Hall of Fame in a sense
again because of the tremendous impact that this type
of robotics has had on society.
The fact that society as we know it would not
exist without robotics and automation
in assembly, in manufacturing, and industry,
and in many, many parts of industry,
places that we don't see in everyday life,
but nonetheless they support a lot of the things
that we do use in everyday life.
So the world of industrial robot arms.
I've chosen here a model of the PUMA robot arm, a well known
robot from this first wave of traditional robot arms
to illustrate this.
So in this first stage of robotics
having an impact on society through industry,
how were these robots really used?
And now we can look at the tools that we've
acquired throughout this class.
And what really happens is that, in general,
for a robot like this, somebody will come and specify, and say,
I'd like, for example, the end effector
to be placed at a specific location in the environment
where it'll pick something up, and then
I'd like the end effector to go to a different location
in the environment where it'll put the object down.
So for example a human will specify
this is the position of the end effector that I'd like,
and then inverse kinematics will translate that
to a set of joint positions.
And then the robot goes ahead and executes that.
Maybe it's a welding robot, so we don't just
care about one position for the end effector.
Maybe we'd like the end effector to describe a certain path
in the environment.
So then a human operator will say
this is the path that I'd like the end effector to take,
and then we'll have Cartesian control translate that
into joint velocities.
Or maybe it's a different kind of task,
and the human operator is directly
telling us the joint values that they'd like the robot to go to.
In all of these cases, there is a human operator.
The input, these three arrows, are
coming from a human operator telling
the robot where it needs to go.
The output is joint positions, desired joint positions
or desired joint velocities.
And in the class, this is kind of what we've been looking at.
How do you get those joint positions?
How do you get those joint velocities?
And we've been content to say that once you have them,
they get sent to the robot, and the robot executes them.
What actually happens behind the scenes
is that these robots will be running controllers
at each joint.
These controllers in general will
have an update loop that's very, very fast, probably
more than 1 kilohertz or at least 1 kilohertz.
But once you send a desired joint position
goal to the controller-- this is a traditional feedback
controller, probably you know a PID or something similar
that will make sure that the joint position that you've
requested actually gets executed.
And this is where there is a closed loop
because what happens is that the motor or the joint
will have a position encoder.
So at any time, the robot knows the very precise position
of its joints.
So the motor controller will close the loop.
We'll send current commands to the motor,
and the loop will be closed with motor position
or joint position information from the encoder.
And this is the loop that is closed very fast, again,
and makes sure that the joint positions
we command get executed.
This is an entire aspect of robotics
that's very important that we haven't had a chance to cover
in this class.
But the low level controller is there,
making sure that what we command actually happens.
Then the motor positions the joints.
The joints, in turn, move the links,
so the links get position at certain places
in the environment.
As a result, the last link is the end effector,
and the end effector gets placed somewhere
where it does what it needs to do on the world
like pick up an object.
Or maybe the end effector, again, is a welding tool,
so then the end effector does its welding job along the path.
What are a couple of things that I'd like you to notice here
once again, and by now, you are intimately familiar with these
probably.
First of all, the world is very carefully controlled, right?
That's the only way we can ensure the robot isn't really
hitting anything along the way.
This is mostly an open loop behavior.
The only loop that's being closed is at the joint level,
so very, very low level.
This is the only place where the loop is being closed.
And other than that, who's making sure
that the robot isn't hitting anything, that something
unexpected hasn't happened.
Maybe the object is somewhere else than we expected it to be.
Maybe an obstacle has shown up in the world.
Well, who's making sure that doesn't happen?
The human operator, carefully controlling the world,
issuing commands to the robot, and there
is no really automated way to close the loop
throughout this process.
So these robots are performing preprogrammed movements,
but the way they're doing it and a lot of the value that they
bring-- they are incredibly precise, they are tireless--
there is little feedback from the environment.
There's almost no sensing to speak of.
Of course, joint position sensing is a form of sensing.
So it's not like these robots are completely sensorless.
There is sensing.
But there isn't sensing in kind of a higher level
sense, what we'd expect--
vision, for example.
We'll get to that in a second.
So there is little feedback from the environment.
And it would seem like, wait a second.
These are very limited robots.
And in a way, they are, but again,
the impact that they've had on the world is undeniable.
