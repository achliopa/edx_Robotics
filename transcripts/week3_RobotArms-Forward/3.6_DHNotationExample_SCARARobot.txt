Start of transcript. Skip to the end.
Let's do one more full example of a robot specified
in DH notation.
So another DH example.
And here is the specification of the robot.
So what do we notice, just by looking at it, compared
to the previous robot that we've looked at.
For joints, we have a first transform that's fixed.
So this, the first row, has no joint variable in it, right?
So we have a row zero, which means from the base
to the first joint, we have a link.
So that's just a robot where we've
decided by convention that our base coordinate frame is not
at the first joint.
So we have a fixed link in between,
which is always possible.
Four joints.
Three of them are revolute joints.
One of them is a prismatic joint.
Let's sketch it and see what this robot looks like in space.
So we have a base coordinate frame.
x, b; z, b; so this is the base coordinate frame.
I'm not going to draw the x-axis, just for clarity.
OK, so the first row of our table, just a fixed transform.
No rotation around z.
0.5 translation along z, which brings us,
let's say to 0.5 up to here.
Zero translation along x, zero rotation around x.
So the coordinate frame for our first joint is up here.
So that is a fixed link that gets us
from the base coordinate frame to the first joint.
So this is the first, this is L0.
This row, our joint is--
so we have a rotation by Q1 around the z-axis.
So let's move this x0 here.
Just for clarity.
So if we extend this a little bit,
then we're moving like this.
OK, we have no translation along z.
We have 0.7 translation along x.
We've rotated x by Q1.
So we have a translation along x by 0.7.
So let's say that 0.7 brings us to here.
And then we have zero rotation around x.
So we're done with that row.
We can go ahead and draw our coordinate frame.
There's going to be x2, x1.
This is going to be z1.
And we are done with this row of the table.
The next one we have, again, a rotation around z.
Just for clarity, I'm going to draw it going back
towards the original axis.
So if we extend this a little bit.
A positive rotation around z will bring x into y.
So this is actually going to be a negative rotation.
This is minus 2.
But this will just make it easier to draw.
OK, then we'll have zero translation along z,
0.7 along x.
So that will bring us somewhere
let's say, over here.
And we have our next coordinate frame.
So x2, z2.
And we're done with this row of the table.
Now we go to this row.
This is the prismatic joint.
So we have zero rotation around z.
But we have a translation along z.
Again, a positive translation will be moving up.
I'm going to draw it pointing down,
just for reasons that will become clear in a second.
So this is a prismatic joint.
OK, so then this distance is going to be Q3.
And we have no other component.
There's no translation along x.
There's no rotation around x.
So then x3 just points like this.
And z3 points up.
And then finally, the last joint is, again,
rotation around z by Q4.
So this is going to be x4.
z3 is the same as z4, it's unchanged.
And this is Q4.
OK, and we're done.
If we were to sketch an end effector,
then the end effector would maybe look like this.
And again, I mentioned that a positive translation is
obviously along z2 is going up.
So this is a negative translation.
OK, so this is a negative translation.
And now you can get a sense for what this robot looks
like in space, right?
Up to here, it's just the simple robot
that we've talked about in the past.
So you imagine two links, the two parts of my arm,
so the robot is moving like this.
It has one degree of freedom here around the vertical axis.
Another degree of freedom here around this vertical axis.
The base is down at my hip, so down here.
So this is what the robot looks like.
But then from here, it also has an end effector
that can move up and down.
And then finally, rotate.
So if we can go back to the computer for a second,
this is another sketch.
Obviously it's the same as this, except that this one is
a little easier to interpret.
Because now you have the wings of the robot also drawn.
So you can imagine that this robot, right?
This bit right here, this part, moves up and down.
The end effector can rotate around the vertical axis.
So what this robot can do is it can pick things up.
If you imagine this plane right here--
so the plane of the base, for example.
This robot can go ahead and pick up objects
that are sitting in that plane.
Because it can move the effector up and down.
And it can also rotate the end effector.
And can easily pick things up that
are sitting in the plane of the base.
So this type of robot is actually
referred to, as you see here, as a SCARA Robot.
It's a very common kinematic arrangement.
You can look it up.
And you'll easily find videos of this robot in operation.
And a very commonly used pick and place
robot for moving things around in the plane, right?
So this sketch that we just drew by hand, same as this one.
Except this one also shows the lengths sketched a little bit
better, so you can get a sense for what
this robot is used for.
OK, now that we know what the SCARA Robot looks
like from the DH parameters, we've
gotten the sense for the axes, and the orientations.
Now let's actually carry out all the computations
and compute analytically the forward kinematics.
So basically, once again, we have
to take each transform in the DH table
and actually turn it into a transform matrix.
And chain them all together.
So finally the transform from our base coordinate system
to the end effector-- which is going to be, in our case,
transform coordinate frame four--
is going to be--
and let's start at the beginning.
The first transfer that we have here
is a translation by 0.5 along the z-axis.
So we have a transform matrix where
the rotation is the identity.
And then we have a translation by 0.5 along z.
And then we have the rest of the matrix as usual.
We have 0, 0.
The next transfer is going to be a rotation by theta
1 around the local z-axis.
So let's spell that out.
So first we have the rotation part.
It's a rotation around z.
So we know part of the rotation matrix, the easy part, and then
the rest of your typical rotation matrix
around one of the axes.
And then we have no translation in this case.
The next component, we have a translation
by 0.7 along the x-axis.
So for a, so next we have a transformed matrix.
Again with an identity rotation.
And this time we have a 0.7 along x.
All right, the next component, a rotation by theta
2 by Q2 around the z-axis.
So very similar to this one except that it's Q2 not Q1.
And with a zero translation.
OK, another translation.
Again, by 0.7.
Again, along x.
So really the same as this one.
So we can just copy it over.
OK, then we have a translation by Q3
along the local the z-axis.
So this is again an identity rotation.
And then we have the translation by Q3 along z.
And then finally, one last rotation.
Q4 theta 4 around the z-axis.
So another matrix that looks like this one.
And like this one except that this time it is angle Q4.
And then no translation component.
OK, there you go.
This is our forward kinematics.
We can go ahead and carry out the multiplication.
One thing that makes our life easier is that, in general,
whenever we have a translation-- a pure translation--
followed by a rotation, by a pure rotation, right?
So this is a pure translation.
The rotation is identity.
This is a pure rotation or the translation is 0.
So whenever we have two of these,
you can easily check that yes, one thing you can do
is multiply.
But when you multiply, all that happens
is that you essentially concatenate the two matrices.
So you can simply take the translation part
and write it over in that translation component
of the rotation matrix.
So really these two multiplied together really have--
the result has this rotation and this translation.
So we can just do this.
And we can get rid of this one.
The same thing here.
We have a pure translation followed by pure rotation.
Note that this only works if they are in this order.
Translation first, rotation next.
So we can just take the translation
and copy it over here.
And we can get rid of this.
OK, here we have two consecutive translations.
And when you have two consecutive translations,
it's very easy.
You just add up the two translation vectors.
Again, you can carry out the multiplication
and see that that's exactly what you get.
And if we add up this translation vector
and this translation vector, basically we're
going to get a 0.7 here.
And we can't get rid of this.
And then finally, here again, we have
a pure translation followed by a pure rotation, right?
So we can just dig the translation. bit
and copy it over here.
OK, so now this is our forward kinematics for the SCARA Robot.
And we're not going to carry out the multiplications here.
But you can see that it's really nothing all that complicated.
Just two more matrix multiplications.
And you've got yourselves a nice analytical formulation
for the former kinematics for this particular robot.
