With this, we're wrapping up the lecture on kinematic chains
and forward kinematics.
The things to remember are that kinematic chains are simply
collections of links and joints.
Different values of the joints mean that the robot is moving
and the end effector-- but also all the other links--
move in space.
That in order to characterize a robot,
you need information about these transforms,
the transforms associated with the links, which never change,
which are rigid; and the transforms
associated with the joints, which
depend on the joint values.
That information can be given to you in multiple ways,
and we've seen two ways of doing it--
URDF, the Universal Robot Description Format,
and DH, DenavitHartenberg-- parameters.
The first one, URDF, used in ROS, used in research;
DH parameters heavily used in industry.
And then using that information, forward kinematics
is the task of computing the pose of all the links,
and in particular the end effector,
given the joint angles.
