So let's formalize the concept of a robot arm.
What is a robot arm from an analysis standpoint?
And from this point on, we're actually
going to start using the more general term
of kinematic chain.
What is a kinematic chain?
Formally it's a sequence of two things.
It's a sequence of links and joints.
The links are simply the rigid components
that comprise the arm.
The joints are articulations, things that can move.
So in general you can think of my upper arm is a link.
The elbow is a joint.
The lower arm is also a link.
The wrist is a joint, and so on.
And an important thing to remember
is that when we're doing kinematic analysis,
joints are generally modeled as having a single what's
called degree of freedom, a single direction of movement,
a single possibility of movement.
If a real life joint can move in more than one way,
then we model it as a sequence of joints each
of them having a single degree of freedom.
What does that mean?
It generally actually means that joints,
in this type of analysis that we do here,
we can really only have two types, so two types of joints.
There's a revolute joint which again
think about it as a hinge.
My elbow is a hinge joint.
There's only one type of movement it can do.
It can rotate around one axis.
What about, for example, the shoulder?
The shoulder can do rotations around multiple axes.
And in this case, actually in the case of the shoulder,
it can rotate around three different axes.
Well, when we are doing this kind of kinematic analysis,
we model something like the shoulder
as a sequence of three joints, each joint being
of this type, a revolute joint with a single axis of rotation.
The other type of joint that we deal with,
which the human body doesn't really
have one, so it's harder to illustrate,
is a prismatic joint.
A prismatic joint allows translation along one axis.
Most of the robots that we've looked at so far in the videos
only had revolute joint.
But prismatic joints are also not all that uncommon.
So each of these joints, a single degree of freedom,
a single possibility of movement.
And what completely characterizes
one of these joints is the joint axis.
The axis for a revolute joint is the axis
around which the joint rotates.
So in the case of, let's say, my elbow,
if I hold my arm like this, then the joint axis is this.
It's the one pointing straight up
because this is the axis that I'm rotating around.
For a prismatic joint, the joint axis
is the axis along which we move.
And then a joint, the current position of a joint,
is defined by what's generally called the joint value, which
is either the angle that I'm currently at if I'm rotating
or how much I've translated in case it's a prismatic joint.
So here is an example of two joints.
So if we sketch a prismatic joint--
there are many conventions about how to sketch something
like a prismatic joint.
But we're going to say this is how we're going
to sketch a prismatic joint.
And then here we're going to have a revolute joint.
So for this prismatic joined, the joint axis
is obviously along this direction.
And the joint value is how much we've translated by.
So this is the joint value.
And in general what we do is, in this course,
we're going to use the letter q to denote the joint value.
So if this is joint one, then the value of this joint is q1.
And q1 tells us how much we've translated
along the joint axis.
And then for the revolute joint, the joint value
is given by this angle, how much we have rotated.
And we're going to use here q2.
This is the value of joint two, how much
we've rotated around our joint axis, which is the axis going
through the board.
So q is a general term for joint values.
It doesn't matter if a joint is prismatic or revolute.
We use the letter q for both of them.
Sometimes if we want to differentiate,
we're going to use the letter d to denote distance
if it's a prismatic joint and the Greek letter theta
to denote angle if we're talking about revolute joints.
So if you see theta for a joint value, it means it's an angle.
It's a revolute joint.
If you see d for a joint value, it's a distance.
It means it's a prismatic joint.
But if you just see q, that's the joint value.
It doesn't really matter if we're
talking about a revolute joint or a prismatic joint.
That is just the value of that particular joint.
So now you can see now, again, what
we mean by kinematic chain--
links connected by joints, each joint having
a single degree of freedom.
Maybe it's a revolute joint.
Maybe it's a prismatic joint.
And we use the more general term kinematic chain
because this doesn't necessarily have
to be what's commonly considered of as an arm, right?
The arm obviously is a kinematic chain,
but then again so is a finger.
Every finger is a kinematic chain.
A leg for that purpose is also a kinematic chain.
So any collection of links connected by joints
is going to be a kinematic chain.
Obviously you can have kinematic chains attached
to other kinematic chains.
I have five fingers attached at the end of the arm.
So that's five small kinematic chains
attached at the end of a larger kinematic chain.
But again, the term is more general
than if we're just thinking about arms.
So what's the purpose of a kinematic chain
in this context?
And we've talked about how really
in many, many applications, what we
care about is a robot arm's ability
to deliver its end effector at a certain location in space.
So really what we often care about the most
is setting some values for all of these joints
such that the end effector gets to some location in space
that we need.
And this becomes the analysis of what's
called forward kinematics.
So forward kinematics really asks,
given the values of all the joints, given specific values
for all the joints, where is my end effector
going to end up in space?
And actually to be a little bit more complete than that,
yes, we care about where the end effector ends up.
But it's not enough to only worry about that.
We don't want, for example, the elbow of the robot
to hit an obstacle.
So we want the end effector to reach somewhere in space,
but we are also concerned about where every link of the robot
is.
So in the most general way to think about it,
let's say that we attach a number of coordinate frames,
that each link of the robot has a coordinate frame attached
to it.
And in yellow here, I've shown a bunch of coordinate frames.
Coordinate frame zero comes after link zero.
That is the base coordinate frame at the base of the robot.
And then there is the last coordinate frame
is the one attached to the end effector.
So forward kinematics asks, for specific values
of all of my joints, where do all of these coordinate frames
end up in space?
What's the transform from my base
coordinate frame to the end effector coordinate frame?
And for that matter of fact, what's
the transform from my base coordinate frame
to every other coordinate frame that I've defined?
Let's think about notation for a little bit.
So the convention that we use in this course
is that a robot is a sequence--
a sequence of links and joints.
And our convention is that joint i is followed by link i.
Then it's preceded by link i minus 1.
And then at the end of link i, we
have a coordinate frame attached.
And that is coordinate frame i.
And obviously this is just a matter of convention,
how we decided to set this subscripts.
But this is the convention that we've used in this class.
And what this generally means is that, for example,
for a robot like this, we're going to have--
let's say if we have n joints, then
we're going to have n plus 1 links.
This assumes that there is a base coordinate frame here.
So the robot starts with a link that's
rigidly attached to the world.
And we have a base coordinate frame
at the beginning of that link.
Obviously that also means we have n plus one coordinate
systems, And one of them being b, the coordinate frame b.
And then there is one attached to every link.
One thing to remember in our convention
is that joint moves link i.
So joint i comes before the link i.
And changing the value of joint i will move link i.
And also by convention for us, coordinate frame i
is at the tip of link i.
So that means, of course, that coordinate frame n
is the end effector.
What we're going to worry about the most
in the next part of the class is where the end effector ends up.
But of course if we know how to compute where the end
effector ends up, we know how to compute
where every coordinate frame that precedes it ends up.
So we have solved the more general problem.
So fundamentally, forward kinematics in this case
means that we are asking the question, what's
the transform from the base of my robot to the end effector?
This is what we're going to spend the next lecture on.
If we know how to answer this question,
then we know really how to characterize the entire robot.
