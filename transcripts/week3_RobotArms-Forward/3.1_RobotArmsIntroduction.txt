OK.
Today we start talking about robot arms.
Why robot arms?
Why do we start with that?
And my personal answer to why robot arms
is such an important topic is because they've
had such a key crucial impact on life as we know it,
on society all around us.
Think, for example, of the smartphone revolution
that people talk about a lot these days--
ubiquitous computing.
Everybody has a computer in their pocket connected
to the internet.
That revolution is not possible if all
of those electronics-- if smart phones are not manufactured
using making heavy use of robots,
which makes them affordable, makes them low cost.
So robot arms have transformed how manufacturing is
done in consumer electronics.
But that actually started way before smart phones.
If you think about the automotive automotive
industry-- cars.
Robots have had a major role in how cars are built.
Robots are part of the reason why
cars are as good as they are, as affordable as they are.
In general, a lot of the technology that
now is in everybody's hands, it is like this thanks
to the use of widespread robotics in manufacturing
industry.
So robot arms, mainly in manufacturing, in assembly,
that's where they are being very, very heavily used.
They're not so present in everybody's eyes.
You know, most of us, we can happily live our entire lives
never seeing an industrial robot arm in operation.
And that can easily lead us to say, hey, wait a second,
for all this talk about robotics, all these movies
that we've seen, where are the robots?
Why am I never seeing a successful working robot
in everyday life?
And one of the answers is well, those successful working robots
have actually transformed all of our lives.
It's just that they are working behind the scene.
They are working somewhere where most of us
don't have any reason to go, in manufacturing, in assembly--
everything from cars to consumer electronics
and many, many things in between.
OK.
So let's take a look at just a couple of examples
of industrial robot arms in operation
so you can get a sense of the kind of applications
that we're talking about here.
And these are videos that I've chosen
from two very well-known manufacturers
of industrial robot arms.
One of them is European--
Kuka Robots from Germany.
These are just videos from the company's public YouTube
channel.
They're not hard to find.
If you search the internet, you will easily
find many, many examples like this of industrial robot arms
in operation.
And here is the Kuka robot doing a machine tending task.
It's basically loading and unloading
a machine that is processing parts.
So you can get a sense of what the robot arm does, right?
It's main role here is to move things in space,
to pick up parts from one side of the enclosure,
place them in the machine, then again, pick them up
from the machine, and place them on a table.
So some things to look at, right?
An important thing here, the key role of the robot
is to deliver its end effector at a precise location in space
where it picks up the part.
Then it has to exit this trajectory through space,
move the part to a new location-- obviously,
without hitting anything--
precisely insert it in the machine.
Then it comes out.
It waits for the machine to do its job.
One thing to look at is the end effector.
Notice how, first of all, this robot has multiple custom end
effectors all in one.
So the end effector typically does not
come with the robot itself.
The end effector is custom built for the task.
And here you see that the robot has
this custom built gripper, which is designed
to pick up an individual part.
A little earlier you saw a pick up an entire tray.
Here it switches to a suction gripper
to pick up an entire sheet.
And throughout, it does kind of similar things, right?
It delivers the end effector to a very precise location
in space.
Where here it picks something up,
then it executes this smooth, elegant trajectory
to place its payload at a new location.
And then goes ahead and picks up a new payload.
Here again, it switched to a different kind of gripper
in order to pick up the part and place it
at a defined location in space.
And then this robot does it again.
And again, and again, repeats the task.
Let's look at a couple of more examples.
Where do robot arms really right now shine?
What are some areas where they really
exceed human capabilities?
They are tireless, in a sense.
That's one, right?
They repeat the task again and again exactly the same way.
They can be incredibly precise, much more precise than a human.
So here's an example of a Kuka robot doing a task, actually
installing screws on a cell phone.
So this is a consumer electronics example.
And you saw the size of the screw
relative to the human hand.
So here is the robot doing these incredibly precise tasks.
And actually, robot arms can even
do tasks requiring even more precision than this.
So precision is a place where really robot companies compete,
one of the specs that they compete on,
and one area where the robot can exceed human capabilities.
Another thing to notice in this video.
Look how fast the robot moves between picking up its payload
and putting it down.
That's another example of where robot arm scan exceeds
human capabilities-- speed, and another place
where robotics companies compete in terms of who can deliver
the best specifications.
So it's one thing that's very important here
to the user of the robot is turnaround time, how
quickly the robot can execute a number of these screwing tasks.
So look how fast the robot moves in between its goals,
but on the other hand, also, how smooth the motion is.
And this is an example of the kind of introspection
that the robot offers.
This is the interface that the user has
to program these trajectories.
And again, you see the robot executing it.
So this is an example of precise,
being fast, precise at a relatively small scale.
Let's look at even more examples.
But this time, let's go at the other end of the size spectrum.
Now we're talking big tasks.
This is a sheet--
a metal sheet bending robot.
Now here's another example of where a robot arm can exceed
human capabilities-- strength.
Right?
A robot can be precise and tireless, but also at a scale--
and things like mass, volume--
bigger than it's possible for humans to operate at
or to be just as precise.
So here is an example of the robot picking up sheet metal.
It's doing an alignment step.
Again, notice the suction gripper,
custom designed for this task.
And then it's picking up the piece of sheet metal,
inserting it into the machine, and that's
where the bending task occurs.
Re-orienting, picking up the part in a different way,
and then placing it down, and starting again
with another piece of sheet metal.
And if I haven't convinced you yet
that, in terms of sheer scale, strength, industrial robot
arms can exceed human capabilities,
let's look at another example.
This time we are looking at a different manufacturer.
This is Fanuc, a very large manufacturer
of industrial robot arms.
And this is meant to show precision, smooth operation
at a scale and mass that really obviously exceeds
human capabilities.
What are we talking about here?
So this is an example of the robot moving around a car.
And even at this scale, at this mass,
industrial robot arms are capable of achieving
really impressive repeatability, precision.
Not the same as when operating at small scales, but still,
what we're talking about here obviously far
exceeds human capabilities.
And then one more example, also from Fanuc.
Here is an industrial robot arm, but this time
not in assembly or manufacturing,
but in a different application domain.
So here is a team of arms, if you wish,
doing what's called palletizing--
so taking these beverage cases and assembling them in pallets.
Notice how one robot was feeding one conveyor belt from another,
and then a different robot, large, very powerful,
is picking up an entire set of these cases,
and putting them on a pallet.
So here is an example of industrial robot arms
being critical in the logistics part of the business,
shipping, moving things around.
So really, industrial robot arms are touching every aspect
of our lives, even though they are not
in places where we would normally see them.
Interestingly, though, one place where these kind of robot arms
are very visible-- although I'm not
sure it's what people will focus on.
These are the opening credits to a very popular HBO TV
show called Westworld, which many of you
probably are watching.
And there you go.
Those are robot arms.
Here they are essentially acting as 3-D printers.
Any 3-D printer is a robot, by the way.
But here what this robot arms are building
is actually what looks like biological organisms,
almost, right?
So in this particular example, this is an artificial being.
And there are so many things that we
don't know about in terms of how to build these.
This is still the domain of science fiction.
And this is where a lot of what's
commonly considered artificial intelligence goes into.
But what I'd like it to focus on in this image
is not the center, but these guys right here.
This is what we care about at this point in the course.
These we know how to build.
And I love the fact that, even in this science fiction
setting, the authors have found it--
needed to show that, look, even in the process of building
these highly advanced intelligent machines,
we are still going to need something
like industrial robot arms.
Industrial robot arms have transformed
society, life as we know it.
And if the imagination of the creators of this show
is anything to go by, then they'll continue to do it,
and they will be crucial in inventing
and us building the next stage of technology, which we don't
even know how to build yet.
So the next couple of letters are about these robots.
And who knows?
Maybe some years from now it's you
that will be building this generation of robots,
really combining robotics as we know it today
with the successes it has achieved already
with the new artificial intelligence that's
being discovered as we speak.
One more aspect to consider, again,
combining the concepts of robotics-- industrial
robotics-- and artificial intelligence.
So all the examples that I've shown you they
talk about robot arms as very efficient, precise, powerful,
tireless ways to move to deliver an end effector at a desired
location in space, to move it around, place it
somewhere else.
One thing that really separates these applications where robots
are already widely deployed and the applications of the future
is, where does this information come from?
Who tells the robot where it needs to go in space?
And for now we are going to imagine
that that information is given to us
by the operator of the robot.
If I am a user of an industrial robot,
and I get my robot from one of these manufacturers,
then what will happen is a person
will program this robot with the trajectories
that it has to follow.
So in this next couple of lectures,
in general, we're going to assume
that where the robot has to go in space
is given to us by a human operator,
by a human programmer.
And in these industrial settings,
that is generally the case.
Now, think about a robot in your kitchen,
looking to open the fridge and to make a sandwich.
Obviously, it's not feasible for a human operator
to tell the robot exactly where to place the end
effector to find the cheese, to find the bread.
So a lot of the next generation robotics,
and especially robotics and artificial intelligence,
is concerned with this kind of high level questions.
Where should a robot place its end effector
in space, especially in a complicated cluttered scene?
We are not there yet in the course.
So for now, we are saying this is a robot
that a human operator has instructed about where it
has to go, how it has to move.
And we're going to learn about how the robot actually
executes that motion--
in a sense, the nuts and bolts.
And only after we've really mastered this component
can we start talking about robots that
have the artificial intelligence to know what they have
to do on their own, based on sensory input from the scene,
for example, and knowing how to operate in environments
they've never seen before.
So for now, we are worried more about
how does the robot actually do what it needs to do,
assuming that a human operator has given it
very precise instructions about where it needs to go in space.
