## Self-Assessment Activity 


### Jacobians

* This section is designed to introduce the Jacobian matrix using a simple example that resembles more difficult problems you will see later in the course.
* This assessment tests the following skills:
    * Making a function in Python
    * Building a matrix in Python
    * Partial differentiation
* Problem: Given the following system of equations: Define a Jacobian matrix with partial derivatives of functions x and y with respect to a and b

> x = A*cos(a) + B*cos(a+b)

> y = A*sin(a) + B*sin(a+b)


|   J = |       |
|  ---  |  ---  |
| dx/da | dx/db |
| dy/da | dy/db |

* we calculate the derivatives

> x = A*cos(a) + B*cos(a+b) = A*cos(a) + B*cos(a)*cos(b) - B*sin(a)*sin(b) 

> y = A*sin(a) + B*sin(a+b) = A*sin(a) + B*sin(a)*cos(b) + B*cos(a)*sin(b)

> dx/da = - A*sin(a) - B*sin(a)*cos(b) - B*cos(a)*sin(b) = - A*sin(a) - B*sin(a+b) = -y

> dy/da = A*cos(a) + B*cos(a)*cos(b) - B*sin(a)*sin(b) = A*cos(a) + B*cos(a+b) = x

> dx/db = A*cos(a) - B*cos(a)*sin(b) - B*sin(a)*cos(b) = A*cos(a) - B*sin(a+b)
  
> dy/db = A*sin(a) - B*sin(a)*sin(b) + B*cos(a)*cos(b) = A*sin(a) + B*cos(a+b)

```
import numpy as np

# Coefficients - in meters
A = 0.7
B = 0.3

# Angles - in degrees
a = 45
b = 60

# x = A*cos(a) + B*cos(a+b)
# y = A*sin(a) + B*sin(a+b)

# J = [dx/da, dx/db
#      dy/da, dy/db]


def compute_jacobian():
    J = np.ndarray((2,2))
    ###
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    J[0,0] = - A*np.sin(a*np.pi/180) - B*np.sin((a+b)*np.pi/180)
    J[0,1] = A*np.cos(a*np.pi/180) - B*np.sin((a+b)*np.pi/180)
    J[1,0] = A*np.cos(a*np.pi/180) + B*np.cos((a+b)*np.pi/180)
    J[1,1] = A*np.sin(a*np.pi/180) + B*np.cos((a+b)*np.pi/180)

    return J

J = compute_jacobian()
print (J)
```

### Trigonometric Functions

* In this section, you are going to find the angle between two vectors with the help of trigonometric functions.
* Vector a = [1, 0] and b = [x, y] are in the same plane. Try to get the angle(-180, 180] between these two vectors
    * Use math.degrees() function to convert radian to angle.
    * Please choose the appropriate function from the following ones: math.sin(), math.asin(), math.cos(), math.acos(), math.tan(), math.atan(), math.atan2(), math.fabs().
```
import math
import numpy as np
# Complete the function below

def angle2D(x, y):
    ###
    ### YOUR CODE HERE
    a = np.array([1,0])
    b = np.array([x,y])
    angle = math.degrees(math.acos(((a[0]*b[0])+(a[1]*b[1]))/(np.linalg.norm(a)*np.linalg.norm(b))))
    ###
    return angle
# Run this cell to generate vector b

b = np.random.randint(-10, 10, 2)
x = b[0]
y = b[1]

if x == 0 and y == 0:
    x = 1
    y = 1

angle1 = angle2D(x, y)
```

* Now, you are going to get the angle between two vectors c = [c0, c1, c2] and d = [d0, d1, d2] in the same 3D space
    * Use math.degrees() function to convert radian to angle.
    * Please choose the appropriate function from the following ones: math.sin(), math.asin(), math.cos(), math.acos(), math.tan(), math.atan(), math.atan2(), math.fabs().
```
# Complete the function below

def angle3D(c, d):
    ###
    angle = math.degrees(math.acos(np.dot(c,d)/(np.linalg.norm(c)*np.linalg.norm(d))))
    ###
    return angle
# Run this cell to generate vector c and d

c = np.random.randint(-10, 10, 3)
d = np.random.randint(-10, 10, 3)

if np.linalg.norm(c) == 0:
    c = np.array([1,1,1])
if np.linalg.norm(d) == 0:
    d = np.array([-1,-1,-1])

angle2 = angle3D(c, d)
```

### Project 0 (Ungraded)

* This assignment is meant to make sure that you are familiar with the most basic functions of ROS. It is an ungraded project that all students can work on. We encourage students who have not yet signed up for the verified track to try this project and get a sense of the type of projects you will see in this course.
* In this assignment you must write a publisher node that publishes a message. You will publish a single value of type String from std_msgs that contains the message "robotics is fun" to the topic called 'quotes'. The grader will be subscribed to this topic and receive the message that you publish.
* Setup
    * Access your Vocareum workspace for Project 0
    * Start by running `source setup_project0.sh`  in the command line terminal. You should do this first every time you load or reload your workspace. You must run this command before trying to invoke any ROS commands (catkin_make, roscd, etc.). This will also start a roscore for your session. Please do not start your own roscore.
* Implementation
    * You must implement your code in the file `~/catkin_ws/src/project0_solution/scripts/solution.py` . This file has already been created for you and any starter code has been placed inside. 
* Testing
    * To test your code, you have multiple options:
    * Add some debug output to your publisher (i.e. print the number you have just received every time you are about to publish). 
      Then simply run your node `rosrun project0_solution solution.py`. This is useful to see that you are getting to the right place in your code, but will not tell if you are actually publishing, and publishing to the right topic.
    * Simply submit your code. Your code will be automatically graded and after a short while you should find a 'Submission Report' under the 'Details' tab which will contain output from the grading script.
    * (Requires more advanced Linux skills) Run your node in the background `rosrun project0_solution solution.py &`. 
      This frees up the console so you can manually subscribe to the quotes topic `rostopic echo quotes` and see that something is indeed being published. 
      Of course, you'll then need to manually kill your node, by retrieving the right process number and sending it a SIGINT signal using the `kill <PID>` command.
* solution: the publisher node sending message to topic every 2 sec
```
